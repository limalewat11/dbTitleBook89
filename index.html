<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism</h2><p><blockquote><p>&#x201c;This transformation of competition into monopoly is one of the most important &#x2013; if not the most important &#x2013; phenomena of modern capitalist economy.&#x201d;</p></blockquote> <p>During the First World War, Lenin found himself isolated, but he was not afraid to fight against the stream. He dedicated all his strength to educating and training the Bolsheviks on the basis of the genuine ideas of Marxism. His masterpiece, Imperialism: <em>The Highest Stage of Capitalism</em>,<em> </em>is an immortal monument to his work in the vital field of theory.</p> <p>No book has ever explained the phenomena of modern capitalism better. Indeed, all of Lenin&#x2019;s predictions concerning the concentration of capital, the dominance of the banks and finance capital, the growing antagonism between nation states and the inevitability of war arising out of the contradictions of imperialism have been shown to be true by the entire history of the last 100 years.</p> <p>The Communist Manifesto already explains that free competition inevitably gives rise to monopoly and the concentration of capital in a few giant enterprises. However, this process did not culminate during the life time of Marx and Lenin was in a position to analyse it in great details. Using the vast amount of statistics at his disposal, he outlines this process.</p> <p>Lenin further explains that in the stage of imperialist monopoly capitalism, the entire economy is under the domination of the banks and finance capital. Today, over one hundred years after it was first published, this domination is 100 times greater. Lenin&#x2019;s text therefore stands as required reading for anyone fighting to change society.</p></p><p></p><h2>Gotham City Sirens Book One</h2><p><b>From Emmy and Eisner Award-winning Paul Dini (DETECTIVE COMICS, <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>) comes GOTHAM CITY SIRENS BOOK ONE!</b><br><br>Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn&#x2014;they&#x2019;re beautiful, they&#x2019;re deadly, and for the first time in their lives, all three are trying to fly on the straight and narrow.

Written by four major saints, the greatest exponents of this poetic form, between the tenth and twelfth centuries, they are passionate lyrical expressions of the search for an unpredictable and spontaneous spiritual vision of 'now'. Here, yogic and tantric symbols, riddles and enigmas subvert the language of ordinary experience, as references to night and day, sex and family relationships take on new mystical meanings. These intense poems of personal devotion to a single deity also question traditional belief systems, customs, superstitions, image worship and even moral strictures, in verse that speaks to all men and women regardless of class and caste.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He reveals the loneliness he felt as a teenager leaving America to join the Paris Opera Ballet School, the ambition he had to tame as a new member of American Ballet Theatre, and the reasons behind his headline-grabbing decision to be the first American to join the top rank of Bolshoi Ballet, tendered by the Artistic Director who would later be the victim of a vicious acid attack. Then, as Hallberg performed throughout the world at the peak of his abilities, he suffered a crippling ankle injury and botched surgery leading to an agonizing retreat from ballet and an honest reexamination of his entire life.<br> <br>Combining his powers of observation and memory with emotional honesty and artistic insight, Hallberg has written a great ballet memoir and an intimate portrait of an artist in all his vulnerability, passion, and wisdom.<b> &#x201c;</b>Candid and engrossing&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>), <i>A Body of Work </i>is a memoir &#x201c;for everyone with a heart&#x201d; (DC Metro Theater Arts).</p><p>David Hallberg is a Principal Dancer with American Ballet Theatre in New York. He was the first American to join the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow as a Principal Dancer. He continues to dance around the world and is a Resident Guest Artist with The Australian Ballet. He has also started the David Hallberg Scholarship, mentoring young aspiring boys in a career in ballet, and the Innovation Initiative, a platform for emerging choreographers, both at American Ballet Theatre. <i>A Body of Work</i> is his first book.A Body of Work CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>Morning class was an essential daily task. Like making that pot of coffee first thing in the morning. Out of bed, half-asleep, and straight to the coffee machine. Filter. Water. Coffee grinds. On switch. Every day. Day in. Day out.<br> <br>By nine thirty a.m. I would shuffle into a worn studio that was always empty and silent. The only light came from the morning sun edging in through huge windows. Outside, one floor down, the streets and noise of New York City.<br> <br>At first, my body resisted the task at hand, especially when I was drained from the previous night&#x2019;s performance. But the work continued the following morning, as if no exertion occurred, as if I hadn&#x2019;t given to the performance every ounce of my emotional and physical energy.<br> <br>I started with what I often dreaded: that first small physical movement that would call me to attention, easing me out of my slumber into another day. I would always begin with the same exercises. Done at my own pace and with the understanding that if I skipped them, I would not be set up well for later, when I would need to push my body in order to transform ballet&#x2019;s absurdly difficult steps into seemingly effortless movement onstage. I began with small, basic movements, continuing on to those that are more advanced and complicated, each of them essential to achieving huge jumps and whiplash turns. People often wonder why we need daily ballet class when we are already professionals. But it is when we are performing virtuoso moves that we need those classes more than ever.<br> <br>The deeper I went into the movements, the further I escaped into thought. The exercises slowly became a meditative experience. My mind would wander to last night&#x2019;s show, my coming travels, the day&#x2019;s rehearsals, a project I wanted to develop, a choreographer I needed to contact, emails I needed to write.<br> <br>As the start of class drew near, other dancers trickled into the studio, shuffling in just as tired as I was. Everyone spoke in hushed tones. The lights would be turned on by someone who needed to feel they were officially starting class. As more dancers arrived, the volume and energy picked up. Some chatted about the show the night before, about what they did after it. Others discussed the new ballet they were learning, talking as they stretched or strengthened. A few, with headphones on, weren&#x2019;t yet awake enough to discuss anything. We all wore different &#x201c;uniforms.&#x201d; Mine was Nike sweatpants, tights underneath, a cotton T-shirt, an insulated track jacket. Traditionalists wore nothing but tights and a T-shirt or leotard, as we all did when we were training and weren&#x2019;t allowed to wear &#x201c;junk&#x201d;: the sweatpants, leg warmers, and baggy clothes that obscure the body and keep it from being exposed to the teacher&#x2019;s critical eye. But I like junk. It&#x2019;s comfortable.<br> <br>Fads in dance attire come and go. In the 1970s and &#x2019;80s the more tattered and ripped your practice clothes were, the better. Maybe the wear suggested the dancer was working harder than others or was too dedicated and rehearsing too hard to take the time to buy new clothes. That has changed. I&#x2019;ve gotten flak from my colleagues for having holes in my dancewear. When I was promoted to Principal Dancer a friend said, &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re making Principal salary, so you can afford some better-looking clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>But class is not a catwalk. The important thing is not how good the clothes look on the dancer; all that matters is what&#x2019;s being danced in those clothes.<br> <br>Moments before class was to begin, the teacher and accompanist would enter the studio, the former standing in the front of the room, the latter taking a seat at the grand piano.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we ready?&#x201d; the teacher would ask, &#x201c;or do we need five more minutes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Always five more minutes. Compulsory for dancers to do their last stretches, yoga positions, exercises with weights. Or merely to delay the recognition that the day&#x2019;s responsibilities were calling.<br> <br>Grace period over, the talking ceased. We assumed our usual places at the barre. These barre spots are not free for the taking. There is, in every ballet company in the world, a pecking order. All the spots&#x2014;by the piano, by the mirror, at the end, in the center&#x2014;are accounted for. Some are claimed by Principal Dancers, others by members of the Corps de Ballet who have stood in the same spot for years. When outsiders come to take class with a company, they know not to claim a place at the barre until class starts. And God help the new kid who takes a much-coveted spot.<br> <br>With one hand placed on the barre, we began with pli�s. The most basic of movements. A dancer&#x2019;s training commences at a very young age and starts with pli�s at the barre. Whether you&#x2019;ve danced once or a thousand times, it is the pli� that begins your day.<br> <br>A pli� is a bending of the knees with the feet positioned in specific ways. This fundamental movement is the precursor to more advanced steps. Every turn and every jump&#x2014;however high or low&#x2014;starts with a pli�. It&#x2019;s the essential taking-off point to things far more difficult and impressive. For so many years I did pli�s every day with a mindless ease and agility gained through repetition. I had done this series of exercises daily for twenty years. That is what we do: repeat the same movements every day throughout the entirety of our careers. It never ceases. If we think we don&#x2019;t need class and the daily focus it provides, our work slips and that slippage is eventually visible on the stage. The audience can tell; they may not know in technical terms what isn&#x2019;t working, but they know that something doesn&#x2019;t look right. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t put my finger on it,&#x201d; they&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;but it didn&#x2019;t quite do it for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>So class is critical; if the basics go, the rest goes with them.<br> <br>As we moved along to more strenuous movement, still holding on to the barre, my mind would drift again. At times I would become bored. Distracted. Want another coffee. I would look out the window, wishing I could take advantage of the beautiful day. Especially on Saturdays, when it seemed that everyone in New York City was just a few blocks away, leisurely strolling through the stalls at the Union Square Greenmarket. But class pushed on. That was a saving grace. You had to dive in and take motivation from other dancers in the room as you executed the familiar steps in their never-changing order: pli�, tendu, d�gag�, rond de jambe, fondu, frapp�, d�velopp�, grand battements.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>CLASS ALWAYS HAS the same structure: barre followed by center work, during which we execute combinations of steps, some in one place and some moving across the entire studio. As they increase in complexity, class becomes more like a performance, with dancers caught between two desires: to show off to colleagues and to dance for the sheer bliss of moving. As the dancers grow ever warmer, layers of clothing come off, one by one. The daily strip-down to a leotard and tights.<br> <br>After a while, the windows would steam up from the body heat of eighty exhausted, sweating dancers. Inevitably someone would write on them in the same spirit that you&#x2019;d write Wash me! on the dirty windshield of a car. Here, the words were always some variation of I LOVE BALLET!, in all their intended sarcasm.<br> <br>Some dancers would trail out of the studio and leave class early, saving their energy and bodies for the long rehearsal day ahead. But those who stayed would pull off stunning jumps and turns, soaring higher and higher across the studio, unleashing a whirlwind of grand leaps and fleet turns in the air. The pianist&#x2019;s music would propel us as we sought to one-up each other with every successive combination.<br> <br>And the music . . . ah, the music! An essential aspect of dance. The skill and enthusiasm of the pianists and what they choose to play is paramount. Their music could take me beyond where I stood. It could take me into the melody, into the small accents of the downbeat, in front of the phrase, or behind it just a bit. Or, if they were uninspired, their lack of enthusiasm could make the steps seem more grueling, deepen my fatigue, make me momentarily hate my profession. But music, as a whole, allowed me to envisage new ways of inventing my work. Lengthen where I once tightened, ascend more slowly where I once rushed. When I heard something I loved, the steps were forgotten and I just danced. Around me, others would be dancing too, all of us engulfed in the beauty that comes from the fusion of music and movement.<br> <br>That euphoria occurred for me on an early morning in a nondescript daily class years ago. The first chords of Schubert&#x2019;s Moment Musicaux No. 2 took me somewhere beyond my place at the barre. I was simply doing pli�s, but as I heard the first chords of the No. 2 opening, I became lost in its simplistic perfection. Suddenly, I felt I embodied the music. Bending and stretching my legs, coordinating my arm movements, this everyday exercise became something ethereal, heightened, spiritual. There was godliness in the movement. Meaning and purpose. It wasn&#x2019;t the pli�s that changed me. It was the beauty of Schubert that possessed me. This is what music can do to a dancer, if one is open to listening.<br> <br>In such moments of transcendence I was doing what I aspired to do, and loving it in the purest and most primitive way.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>MY MEMORIES OF morning class bring to mind the eternal interplay among dancers that veers between intense competition and mutual support. The extreme physicality and grueling nature of ballet create unusually close attachments. We feel part of a special tribe, drawn together by shared dedication, experience, and the understanding that dance possessed us all at a very young age. Because ballet demands and consumes so much energy and time, for many dancers the world begins and ends with dance. They proceed from class to rehearsal to performance and back to class again, year after year, barely noticing life passing beyond the studio and stage. To fulfill what&#x2019;s asked of us, in a physical sense, we feel that we don&#x2019;t need to interact with the &#x201c;real world.&#x201d; Many of us never do, despite the fact that a knowledge of art and music, literature and poetry provides powerful enhancements to anyone&#x2019;s dancing.<br> <br>Though we become professionals at an early age, we paradoxically remain juvenile in many aspects of our lives. Our schedules are dictated to us, our ballets are chosen for us, our touring schedules are arranged by others. Our conversation revolves, for the most part, around the ballet we&#x2019;re learning, the ballet master we&#x2019;d rather not work with, the performance we wish we could give or the one we already gave. Our colleagues are not only our friends; they become our husbands, wives, one-night stands, occasional enemies, enduring affairs. For dancers throughout the world, all of life seems encapsulated within the confines of their own companies.<br> <br>But unity of the tribe also has a dark side: our devotion to one another is inevitably trumped by our individual desire to succeed. A group of dancers drinking at a bar at night can revert to bitching about other dancers like a clique of chatty schoolgirls ensconced at the popular table. I have been subject to my own demons of jealousy when someone else got a role instead of me, or when I danced the second performance instead of opening night, or when someone else was invited to a ballet company I hadn&#x2019;t yet danced for. All of us are extremely vulnerable, which leaves us craving support from our peers and opens us to moments, in class and rehearsal, when we can laugh together about the silliest, most ridiculous things. We encourage each other through those rehearsals that run late into the evening when we&#x2019;re delirious from the long day&#x2019;s work. We share collective discovery in rehearsals that are euphoric; we remain united through rehearsals that are a living hell. I miss the way that, on an opening night, we huddle together onstage just before the curtain rises and share a moment of &#x201c;we did this together.&#x201d; Even when we hate the ballet we have created with a choreographer, we still stick together, soldiering on to make the experience something constructive. It&#x2019;s a remarkable and invaluable intimacy.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>SOMETHING ELSE I miss: the routine that characterized every performance day. Each dancer has his or her own preshow rituals. No matter where in the world I danced, mine started invariably with morning class, with setting up my body. Then home, or to my hotel, where I&#x2019;d have a relatively large lunch. Chicken, rice, salad. Not too many carbs, no sugars. Filling enough to last me through the performance but light enough to not feel like a weight in my stomach.<br> <br>Soon after eating, full of food and feeling dozy, I would take a nap. One of the ballerinas I have partnered, Gillian Murphy, is famous for her two-hour sleeps. But sleeping for that long before a show would make me too groggy. So my naps lasted half an hour, or an hour at most. The moment I woke to the sound of the insistent alarm, the anxiety and stress of the show rushed into my mind. It&#x2019;s happening, I would think. The wait is over.<br> <br>In the shower, hot water warmed me as I mentally reviewed the steps I would soon dance. After the shower, always a shave. I have a superstition that if I don&#x2019;t shave before the show, it means I have slacked off somehow and am not fully committed to the performance. I normally dressed nicely: suit, good shoes, all intended to emphasize the evening&#x2019;s event, the sense of occasion. Usually there was a dinner afterward with family or friends, or a special treat when I could slip away with my manager and have a couple of drinks and dinner alone at our usual place.<br> <br>I always packed clothes to sweat in when I warmed up before the show, and a greeting card for my ballerina in which I would write a merde note. &#x201c;Merde&#x201d; is the word dancers use when wishing each other good luck. Obviously, we&#x2019;re not going to say &#x201c;break a leg,&#x201d; as actors sometimes do, but that we came to settle on the unlikely &#x201c;merde&#x201d; still amuses me.<br> <br>Before I left the apartment, my feelings were a jumble of anticipation, excitement, and dread. Yet nothing compares to it. The nerves you feel with the show fast approaching. The pressure to dance your absolute best. Troublesome questions would seep in at the last moment, attacking my mind like some plague I didn&#x2019;t know I&#x2019;d contracted. I would careen between confidence and fear.<br> <br>I can do this, let&#x2019;s conquer this!<br> <br>What if I miss this turn? Mess up that lift? Do I have enough stamina? Will I get it right? I have to get it right. I cannot miss this lift! It will all be over if it goes wrong!<br> <br>No matter how much I&#x2019;d prepared, the performance was always a risk. Anything can happen on that stage. Ballets have passages that are incredibly tricky, even potentially dangerous. One misplaced step of the foot and it can painfully twist. One slightly off-kilter landing from a high jump and something can crack that shouldn&#x2019;t. Dancing virtuoso steps can feel like traversing a darkened room trying to avoid a trip wire.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>I&#x2019;VE ALWAYS DREADED that moment when the show is over and the coaches, director, and staff come onstage to talk to the dancers. I&#x2019;d look into their eyes as if to say, &#x201c;Was it good? Did I do okay?&#x201d; When you perform, you subject yourself to judgment and criticism from everyone.<br> <br>And when people who attended the show would praise a performance, I often suspected they were lying. I knew they felt t...</p><h2>Plumbing: Basic, Intermediate &amp; Advanced Projects</h2><p><i>Plumbing: Basic, Intermediate, &amp; Advanced Projects</i> is a comprehensive how-to book that explains the plumbing system from start to finish.

From 1873 to 1915, as Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, Comstock led a crusade against lasciviousness, salaciousness, and obscenity that resulted in the confiscation and incineration of more than three million pictures, postcards, and books he judged to be obscene. But as Amy Werbel shows in this rich cultural and social history, Comstock&#x2019;s campaign to rid America of vice in fact led to greater acceptance of the materials he deemed objectionable, offering a revealing tale about the unintended consequences of censorship.<br><br>In <i>Lust on Trial, </i>Werbel presents a colorful journey through Comstock&#x2019;s career that doubles as a new history of post&#x2013;Civil War America&#x2019;s risqu� visual and sexual culture. Born into a puritanical New England community, Anthony Comstock moved to New York in 1868 armed with his Christian faith and a burning desire to rid the city of vice. Werbel describes how Comstock&#x2019;s raids shaped New York City and American culture through his obsession with the prevention of lust by means of censorship, and how his restrictions provided an impetus for the increased circulation and explicitness of &#x201c;obscene&#x201d; materials. By opposing women who preached sexual liberation and empowerment, suppressing contraceptives, and restricting artistic expression, Comstock drew the ire of civil liberties advocates, inspiring more open attitudes toward sexual and creative freedom and more sophisticated legal defenses. Drawing on material culture high and low, including numerous examples of the &#x201c;obscenities&#x201d; Comstock seized, <i>Lust on Trial</i> provides fresh insights into Comstock&#x2019;s actions and motivations, the sexual habits of Americans during his era, and the complicated relationship between law and cultural change.</p><p>Amy Werbel is associate professor of the history of art at the Fashion Institute of Technology. She is the author of <i>Thomas Eakins: Art, Medicine, and Sexuality in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia </i>(2007)."An incisive history of the futility of censorship." - <i>Kirkus Reviews </i><br><br>"Based on an impressive amount of research into both primary and secondary sources, Werbel's writing possesses a scholarly formality, but also accessibility, elegance, and wit . . . fascinating, page-turning." - <i>Publisher's Weekly</i><br><br>"Werbel, a distinguished art historian, is especially qualified to analyse American visual culture. She gives a richly detailed, deeply researched and lavishly illustrated account of Comstock's career and legacy. His story, she concludes, demonstrates that "a fierce and dogged opponent" may actually be a gift to champions of free speech, energizing and uniting progressives from many classes and causes." - Elaine Showalter, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br><i>"Lust on Trial</i>&nbsp;has its fun side, documenting the long-forgotten netherworld of post-Civil War erotica, both artistic and literary, and the surprising underground popularity of "rubber goods" such as condoms, sex toys, dildos, S&amp;M devices, and other carnal amusements. . . .&nbsp;Unearthing this history is an amazing feat of pop-cultural scholarship." - Anthony Mostrom, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br><br>"The seamless link Werbel provides between the nation's early anti-obscenity battles and current debates over the separation of church and state, rights to privacy, and civil liberties makes&nbsp;<i>Lust on Trial&nbsp;</i>a work more relevant now than ever. As Amy Werbel's titillating manuscript reveals, Comstock put lust on trial... and lust prevailed." - Marcela Micucci, <i>The&nbsp;Gotham Center for New York History Blog</i></p><h2>Scavullo: Photographs 50 Years</h2><p>Celebrates the career of one of the foremost glamour photographers with a collection of his work, including portraits of Elizabeth Taylor, Janice Joplin, Truman Capote, and Sting</p><p>The work of portrait and fashion photographer Scavullo has graced magazine covers and features for 50 years. This retrospective seems to extend the impact and visual power of his photographs by capturing so many familiar stars, models, and actors in a large and beautiful book. This level of artistry is all about imagination. Certainly, the formula of good photography?lens settings, f-stops, exposures, etc.?is ably handled by Scavullo. He also thrives in the darkroom, as shown by the technical quality of his prints. But it is this photographer's mind and intuition that are behind the astonishing portraits of well-known people that seem to capture their very being, energy, and life. Enid Nemy's introduction works very well by restraining its awe and offering the background and life of Scavullo in a few pages.

Before her death in 1996, this Irish writer had received many honors and prizes not only for her luminous short stories but also for several highly regarded novels. William Trevor praised Lavin's ability to "make moments timeless, to illuminate people and places, words and things, by touching them with the magic of the rarely-gifted storyteller." <i>In a Cafe</i> makes available for the first time in the United States a collection of her most beloved pieces as compiled by her daughter. In masterworks such as the title story, an unsettling portrayal of widowhood, and "The Will," which Lavin considered the finest expression of her art, we recognize the justice in Trevor's declaration that "the short story of today owes her a very great debt." <br> <br>"I envy the skill of Mary Lavin. . . . In her capacity to make much out of little, to compress an entire ethos into an apparently banal situation, she reminds us what literature is all about." --Anthony Burgess <br> <br>"I cannot think of any Irish writer who has gone so profoundly without fear into the Irish heart." --V.

From this point of view, Sandra P. Rosenblum examines the principles of performing the music of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and their contemporaries as revealed in a variety of historical sources: their autographs and letters, early editions of their music, original instruments, and contemporary tutors and journals. She applies these findings to such elements of performance as dynamics, accentuation, pedaling, articulation and touch, technique and fingering, ornaments and embellishments, choice of tempo, and tempo flexibility.</p><p>Familiarity with the Classic conventions provides a framework for interpretation and an understanding of the choices available within the style, the amount of freedom a performer has, and which areas are ambiguous. Rosenblum&#x2019;s detailed study, copiously illustrated with musical examples, is invaluable for professional and amateur performers, serious piano students and their teachers and students of performance practices by Scarlatti and Clementi. </p><p>"... is and will remain unsurpassed as the study dealing with performance practice as it pertains to keyboard music of the Classical period." &#x2015;American Music Teacher</p><p>"Rosenblum&#x2019;s monumental achievement is thorough, objective, balanced, and imaginative, a compelling blend of love and respect for the solo, chamber, and concerto literature she addresses." &#x2015;Journal of Musicological Research</p><p>"The extent and quality of her research, the depth of her perception, and her musicianship together break new ground in the study of historic performance practice." &#x2015;Early Keyboard Journal</p><p>"Her attention to details is absolutely scrupulous; no stone unturned, no argument unquestioned or unstated." &#x2015;The Musical Times</p><p>"Its importance to thoughtful musicians cannot be overstated." &#x2015;Choice</p><p>"... thoroughly musicological." &#x2015;Performance Practice Review</p><p>"... indispensable...

The general thesis is that the commandments are immensely important not only for Jews and Christians, but for all persons seeking to find or to reaffirm a moral foundation for their life and for the life of their children, their religious community, and their society.The fact that the commandments are put negatively is immensely important, for it means that the community that claims these commandments and builds on them has to work out for itself the positive import of not having other gods, not worshipping idols, not profaning the sabbath, not killing and stealing, and committing adultery. Put negatively, these commitments become the groundwork for a humanly free and responsible search for the will of God for individual, family, and corporate life today and in any day.It is true that the commandments originate in ancient Israel, are central to the faith of prophets, priests, and sages, and are claimed and made foundational by Jesus for the Christian community. But these commandments also share much with, for example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been presented by the United Nations for adoption by all the nations of earth.The Ten Commandments and Human Rights seeks to show how to avoid moralistic use of the Ten Commandments in religious life today while still affirming that there are absolutely foundational prohibitions that can and must guide the moral life of all peoples. The Ten Commandments need very little revision in order to become such a foundation for a free and responsible life today.</p><p>This highly readable and usable book is once again available, both revised and updated. Harrelson&#39;s interpretation makes each commandment relevant to our faith and our culture. In a day and time when relativism threatens the religious and moral fiber of society, Harrelson paves the way to a new understanding of arguably the most important verses in the Bible.</p><h2>Godforsaken Sea: Racing the World&#39;s Most Dangerous Waters</h2><p>Godforsaken Sea is the hair-raising account of the world's most demanding, dangerous, and deadly sailing race. Around the world, one sailor, one boat, no stops, no assistance.<p> Author Derek Lundy's vivid book follows the field of the 1996 - 1997 Vendee Globe through the race's grueling four-month circumnavigation of the globe, most of it through the terror of the Southern Ocean. </p><p> Lundy narrates the race through the eyes and experiences of sixteen sailors - fourteen men and two women - who embdoy the best and most eccentric aspects of our human condition. There's the gallant Brit who spends days beating back against the worst seas to save a fellow sailor; the Frenchman who bothers to salvage only a bottle of champagne from his broken and sinking boat; the sailor who comes to love the albatross that trails her for months, naming it Bernard; the sailor who calmly smokes a cigarette as his boat capsizes; and the Canadian who, hours before he disappears forever, dispatches this message:</p><p> If you drag things out too long here, you're sure to come to grief.</p><p> With the literary touch of Saint-Exupery and Conrad, Derek Lundy harnesses hurricane-force winds, six story waves, icebergs, and deafening noise. And he lays bare the spirit of the men and women who push themselves to the outer limits of human endeavor - even if it means never returning home.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>The Southern Ocean is the sailor's Everest. These are unquestionably the most dangerous waters in the world: hurricane infested, frigid, wholly unpredictable, and so remote, according to Derek Lundy, that "only a few astronauts have ever been further from land than a person on a vessel in that position." Encircling Antarctica, this fearsome body of water has terrorized sailors and wrecked the ablest of ships throughout maritime history. Imagine, then, a round-the-world, single-handed sailing race of the most extreme kind--no stopping, no assistance--requiring each lone sailor to spend half the total race distance (roughly 13,000 miles) fighting this nightmarish, merciless sea. <p> The race is the Vendee Globe, and <i>The Godforsaken Sea</i> is the story of the 1996-1997 competition. Fourteen men and two women began the race in Les Sables-d'Olonne, France. Six officially finished; three were wrecked and rescued; one sailor performed emergency surgery on himself mid-race; one perished. This is high adventure of the most gripping, perilous sort, demanding a tightly controlled, suspenseful narrative: "Visualize a never-ending series of five- or six-story buildings, with sloping sides of various angles ... moving towards [the sailors] at forty miles an hour. Some of the time, the top one or two stories will collapse on top of them." But Lundy delivers more, weaving a superior fabric of psychology and physics, action and reflection. Even the utter novice will emerge understanding the architecture of racing vessels, the evolution of storms, the physical and psychological courage required to survive five-and-a half months battling the ocean alone. </p><p> Sailing aficionados may already believe that the Vendee Globe is the pinnacle of extreme sports. With Lundy's help, armchair adventurers can dig in and hang on for the ride. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>"The best book ever written about the terrifying business of single-handed sailing--.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lundy tells a harrowing tale, as tight and gripping as <b>The Perfect Storm</b> or <b>Into Thin Air</b>."-- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br> <br>A chilling account of the world's most dangerous sailing race, the Vend�e Globe, <b>Godforsaken Sea</b> is at once a hair-raising adventure story, a graceful evocation of the sailing life, and a thoughtful meditation on danger and those who seek it. <br> <br>This is the story of the 1996-1997 Vend�e Globe, a solo sailing race that binds its competitors to just a few, cruelly simple rules: around the world from France by way of Antarctica, no help, no stopping, one boat, one sailor. The majority of the race takes place in the Southern Ocean, where icebergs and gale-force winds are a constant threat, and the waves build to almost unimaginable heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;As author Derek Lundy puts it: "try to visualize a never-ending series of five- or six-story buildings moving toward you at about forty miles an hour." <br> <br>The experiences of the racers reveal the spirit of the men and women who push themselves to the limits of human endeavor--even if it means never returning home.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll meet the gallant Brit who beats miles back through the worst seas to save a fellow racer, the sailing veteran who calmly smokes cigarette after cigarette as his boat capsizes, and the Canadian who, hours before he disappears forever, dispatches this message: "If you drag things out too long here, you're sure to come to grief." <br> <br>Derek Lundy elevates the story of one race into an appreciation of those thrill-seekers who embody the most heroic and eccentric aspects of the human condition.</p><h2>On the Yard (New York Review Books Classics) (Ign Departement Maps)</h2><p>A major American novel, and arguably the finest work of literature ever to emerge from a US prison, On the Yard is a book of penetrating psychological realism in which Malcolm Braly paints an unforgettable picture of the complex and frightening world of the penitentiary. At its center are the violently intertwined stories of Chilly Willy, in trouble with the law from his earliest years and now the head of the prison&#39;s flourishing black market in drugs and sex, and of Paul, wracked with guilt for the murder of his wife and desperate for some kind of redemption. At once brutal and tender, clear-eyed and rueful, On the Yard presents the penitentiary not as an exotic location, an exception to everyday reality, but as an ordinary place, one every reader will recognize, American to the core.</p><p>At its center are the violently intertwined stories of Chilly Willy, in trouble with the law from his earliest years and now the head of the prison&#39;s flourishing black market in drugs and sex, and of Paul, wracked with guilt for the murder of his wife and desperate for some kind of redemption.

Most people might simply view the book as a dry cataloging of a banal subject; Shapton, however, saw beauty in the technical details and was inspired to create her own interpretation of <i>The Native Trees of Canada.</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Shapton distills each image into its simplest form, using vivid colors in lush ink and house paint. She takes the otherwise complex objects of trees, pinecones, and seeds and strips them down into bold, almost abstract shapes and colors: the water birch is represented as two pulsating red bulbs contrasted against a gray backdrop; the eastern white pine is represented by a close-up of its cone against a radiant summer sky. </p><p>The author of <i>Was She Pretty?</i> and <i>Important Artifacts and Personal Property from the Collection of Lenore Doolan and Harold Morris, Including Books, Street Fashion, and Jewelry</i>, Shapton puts forth yet another entirely new facet of her creative artistry.</p></p><p><p><b>Leanne Shapton</b> is an illustrator, author, art director, and publisher based in New York City.

A married Presbyterian minister in Toronto&#x2019;s east end, Howard was popular with the congregation that elected him, especially with the ladies, and most particularly with Miss Sarah Dignam. Respected in the community, Howard, as Visitor for the House of Industry, sat in judgment on the poor, assessing their applications for the workhouse. <br><br>But now Howard is dead, stabbed and brutally beaten by someone he invited into his office.

Has some poor beggar he turned down taken his vengeance?<br><br>Murdoch&#x2019;s investigation takes him into the arcane Victorian world of queer plungers &#x2014; men who fake injury all the better to beg &#x2014; and the destitute who had nowhere left to turn when they knocked on the Reverend Howard&#x2019;s door.</p><p><b>Maureen Jennings</b>&#x2019;s Detective Murdoch series has been a hit from the start. Published to rave reviews, the first novel, <i>Except the Dying,</i> was shortlisted for both the Arthur Ellis and the Anthony first novel awards. The influential Drood Review picked <i>Poor Tom Is Cold</i> as one of its favourite mysteries of 2001. And <i>Let Loose the Dogs</i> was shortlisted for the 2004 Anthony Award for best historical mystery. <br><br>Three of the novels have been adapted for television, and four seasons of a television series,&nbsp;<i>The Murdoch Mysteries</i>, based on the characters from the novels, have been produced by Shaftesbury Films for&nbsp;CITY TV/Rogers, UKTV in Britain and distributed internationally by ITV/Granada international.<br><br>Born in the U.K., Jennings immigrated to Canada at age seventeen. She now lives in Toronto.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><b><br></b>William Murdoch had recently been promoted from acting to full detective and given a raise in wages of three dollars a month. But his new status was not reflected by a better office, and from his desk he was contemplating the same old furnishings of a battered metal filing cabinet and a visitor&#x2019;s chair that the rag-�and-�bones man would have rejected. The walls, he noticed, would benefit greatly from a fresh coat of paint, as he was wont to use the one wall as a blackboard and the chalk marks never quite rubbed off. He needed a new lamp, or at least some better oil, as the one on his desk was smoking badly.<br><br>Having made this gloomy assessment, he took a gulp of the hot strong tea that he&#x2019;d brought in from the duty room and got back to his task. He dipped his pen into the inkwell. He had a fine working fountain pen in his pocket, but he �couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to write a letter to his absent mistress with a pen his beloved deceased fianc�e had given him.<br><i><br>Dear Enid. I �haven&#x2019;t yet received a letter from you, but I hope that is only because of the bad weather and not because you �don&#x2019;t want to write to me. How is your father faring?</i><br><br>He paused. That last line seemed ridiculously stiff. But he&#x2019;d have to leave it. This was the third draft he&#x2019;d started. Oh just cross out <i>faring</i>, for Christ&#x2019;s sake.<br><i><br>How is your father? I do hope his health is improving.</i><br><br>Of course, the reason she had not written could be because her father had died. If that was the case he wondered if she would return to Canada. And then he wondered how he would feel about that if she did. It had been almost two months since she had been summoned back to Wales to take care of her ailing parent. This had been the primary and acknowledged reason for her departure, but they both knew that sitting just behind it was Murdoch&#x2019;s inability to make up his mind to marry her.<br><br>Another dip in the ink and he made a large blot on the page. <i>Damn.</i> These pens were police issue and leaked badly. His fingers were stained already.<br><i><br>Tell Alwyn I am thinking of him. I have still got his sled and . . .</i><br><br>He&#x2019;d been going to write <i>and I look forward to the time when he returns</i>, but that was implying a promise he �didn&#x2019;t know if he could keep.<br><br>He looked at the letter. It was a mess with two crossing-�outs and three blots. He crumpled it up and threw it into the basket with the others. He&#x2019;d write later at home, not here at the police station where there were distractions. He&#x2019;d heard the clack of the telegram machine in the front hall and decided to get up and see if anything interesting had come over the wire. It had been a quiet day so far.<br><br>He swallowed the rest of his tea and went out into the main hall.<br><br>There were no miscreants or supplicants gracing the wooden bench that ran around the room and it �wasn&#x2019;t time for the shifts to change so the only two officers present were the stenographer, Callahan, and the duty sergeant, Gardiner, who was sitting at his high stool behind the desk. He grinned when he saw Murdoch and waved a piece of paper.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a telegram from Hamilton. Callahan just typed it up.

Typically, they work in groups of three or more.

The second member of the gang will then effect a rescue. The half-�drowned one will be taken to the closest house. They always make sure it&#x2019;s a tavern or failing that a church just emptying of the congregation. Then there is some cock-�and-�bull story about why the poor man wanted to commit self-�murder in the first place. Debts of honour, most like. A go-�around is suggested so he can redeem himself.

Witnessing the arrogance and self-deception firsthand, Vann put his life and career on the line in an attempt to convince his superiors that the war should be fought another way. But by the time he died in 1972, Vann had embraced the follies he once decried. He went to his grave believing that the war had been won.<br><br>A haunting and critically acclaimed masterpiece, <i>A Bright Shining Lie</i> is a timeless account of the American experience in Vietnam&#x2013;a work that is epic in scope, piercing in detail, and told with the keen understanding of a journalist who was actually there.<b> </b>Neil Sheehan' s classic serves as a stunning revelation for all who thought they understood the war.</p><p>This passionate, epic account of the Vietnam War centers on Lt. Col. John Paul Vann, whose story illuminates America&#39;s failures and disillusionment in Southeast Asia. Vann was a field adviser to the army when American involvement was just beginning. He quickly became appalled at the corruption of the South Vietnamese regime, their incompetence in fighting the Communists, and their brutal alienation of their own people. Finding his superiors too blinded by political lies to understand that the war was being thrown away, he secretly briefed reporters on what was really happening. One of those reporters was Neil Sheehan. This definitive expose on why America lost the war won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 1989.&#34;If there is one book that captures the Vietnam war in the sheer Homeric scale of its passion and folly, this is it.&#34;--The New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Discover the Bible for Yourself: Helpful Introductions to Every Book; Practical Approaches for Study; Applications for Everyday Life</h2><p>Book Discover the bible</p><p></p><h2>The Authorized Texas Ranger Cookbook</h2><p>222 pages - filled with recipes of old west cooking by the Texas Rangers - illustrated with old photographs of Texas Rangers in the field</p><p></p><h2>Emperor Mage (The Immortals, Book 3)</h2><p>Sent to Carthak as part of the Tortallan peace delegation, Daine finds herself in the middle of a sticky political situation.

By the award-winning author of A Sideways Look at Time.</p><p>Jay Griffiths is the author of <i>A Sideways Look at Time</i>, winner of the 2003 Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Award for nonfiction. Her writing has appeared in <i>Utne</i>, the <i>London Review of Books</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Observer</i>, <i>The Ecologist</i>, and <i>Wild Earth</i>.Reviewed by Ruth Padel<p> The impulse to identify the world's wilderness with wildness in the human psyche runs deep. "The surface of the Earth," wrote Thoreau, "is soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which the mind travels." But imaginative projection with the wild is far older than Thoreau. Renaissance artists painted desert fathers acting out beside wild animals. Christian saints, like holy men in Buddhist and Hindu traditions, entered the wild and became part of it while triumphing over it. It was in the wilderness that Jesus, too, was tempted. When you step into the wild, you are tangling with your own soul's wildness. As Jay Griffiths points out in her insightful, effervescent and lavishly written new book, "As dreams are essential to the psyche, wildness is to life."</p><p> Griffiths, author of the erudite and quirky book A Sideways Look at Time (2004), is a campaigning environmental journalist and associate editor of the eco-spiritual magazine Resurgence. Wild records a long journey into wilderness and out of depression. After visiting Peruvian shamans in an Amazonian rain forest -- who treated her depression with a drink from a jungle plant and the healing wisdom of the Earth -- she began a seven-year quest for the wild through wilderness of all extreme kinds, from rain forest and desert to ocean and ice, digging insects out of her calves along the Amazon, eating whale-skin with soy sauce on an Inuit floor.</p><p> Her journey followed, in fact, the spiritual path described in the 17th-century religious poem "The Pilgrimage," by George Herbert. She goes from "The gloomy cave of Desperation" to "the wilde of Passion, which/ Some call the wold." Herbert described this wilderness as "A wasted place, but sometimes rich," and Griffiths's writing is both a hymn to that richness and a wake-up call to care about the wild at a critical time for wilderness everywhere. In the 1990s, the rate of animal extinctions became 10 times the natural one -- 100 times in tropical forests. Unless governments everywhere intervene to protect it, there may not be much wilderness around in the future to test our own psyches in. Griffiths, like Thoreau, believes that "In wildness is the preservation of the world." </p><p>She shrouds her amazingly strenuous physical journey with a rich literary penumbra. The book has a profusion of historical allusions and a fertile bibliography; the vivid, excited writing draws haunting, lovely connections among multiple cultures, landscapes and ideas. </p><p>Some readers, though, may be put off by the romantic largeness of her claims. "The ancient Greeks," she says, "believed the Ocean is where the earth ended and heaven began and the whales knew that too." Most sentences beginning "the ancient Greeks believed" derive from what one ancient Greek once wrote. Ancient Greeks lived in hugely different times and places and believed a lot of different things. What prehistoric whales once "knew" is even more unverifiable. </p><p>Humor is important to Griffiths's writing and to her philosophy. "At the core of life is levity," she says. But the way she handles levity does not serve the cause she cares about when it blurs the distinction between scientifically provable truth and imaginative sympathy -- between, for instance, knowledge attributed to ancient cetaceans and knowledge claimed by shamans you can talk to. </p><p>Conservationists struggling to preserve the wild need knowledge to be provable if they are to be globally respected. The more you know about a species, the better you can understand it and demonstrate its long-term needs to governments that prefer to allow whaling or large-scale logging. Field biologists who spend their life in the wild will turn away impatiently from comments such as "Whales, who presumably knew that the Earth was round a long time before humans, ascertained that fact, knew it was finite in area but infinite in beauty and paradisality." But many readers will respect and treasure her wide focus, the creative links Griffiths makes between erudition and geographical experience, whether of outer Mongolia or the deserts of Afghanistan, and above all her passionate engagement with her vital subject. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

In <i>In Atkins for Life</i>, he continues his decades-long crusade against low-fat eating. Atkins argues that low-fat meals are high-carbohydrate missiles, causing the body to produce excess insulin, which then produces fat, slows down metabolism, and tips the scale. Instead, he urges readers to stop counting calories and fat grams and start counting carbs to rev up their metabolism and burn fat as an energy source. The question of whether "ketosis," the fat meltdown he advocates, is healthy or harmful is a central question of this sequel to the bestselling <i>Dr. Atkins&#x2019; New Diet Revolution</i>. Packed with recipes, menus, carbohydrate counters, and strategies for staying with the plan, this book is less clear than its predecessor. It veers back and forth between how to begin and how to maintain "a controlled carbohydrate lifestyle." It is also more promotional, with photos of satisfied slim folks and pitches for the branded Atkins products. Still, with its pages of testimonials and studies about weight loss, lowered cholesterol, and increased energy, it is hard to argue with Atkins&#x2019;s results. He puts his proof in the pudding. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i>Robert C. Atkins, M.D., was the founder and medical chair of The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York City.

First published in 1987 and translated into more than thirty languages, this spiritual classic reveals the connection between our own personal happiness and the state of the world around us. <br><br>Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s key practices are resented in simple and clear language, offering practical suggestions for how to create a more peaceful world "right in the moment we are alive." <i>Being Peace</i> is a must-have for those interested in Buddhist practice and a perfect starting point for anyone concerned about how to create peace in themselves and the world.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Peace Is Every Step</i>. He lives in Plum Village in southwest France, where he teaches the art of mindful living.At sixty-two poet, author, and Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh is the perfect embodiment of his teachings of sociallyengaged Buddhism. For the past two decades, exemplifying the Buddhist principles of compassion and reconciliation, he has lived and taught primarily in France and America. two wealthy, powerful countries that did their best to destroy his homeland, Vietnam. Being Peace is a jewel of love and wisdom, a mirror reflecting our own happy Buddhahood, as Hanh always points out, and it is a recognition that will inspire everyone, regardless of previous religious persuasion, with the unexpected joy of smiling. Hanh reminds us of the fundamental importance for the world of just one person smiling, breathing, and being peaceand this is empowering. Yet with that distinct Buddhist love for paradox, in the next breath Hanh dissolves our sense of privileged separateness. Engaged Buddhism means we recognize the inextricable interconnectedness of everyone, or in Buddhist parlance, the endless chain of codependent origination. Clouds, water, sunlight, trees, the logger's labor, his breakfast bread"everything is in this sheet of paper." This is the context for meditation, says Hanh, such that when an individual enters the meditation hall, she brings all of society. We meditate the world and we breathe, smile, and be peace for the enlightenment of everyone, for the clarity of everybody's thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. The apparent membrane separating us is very permeable, and the responsibility significant because the Buddha takes refuge in us. Without us, the Buddha isn't real at all, says Hank and Buddhanature goes disembodied. The embodied Buddha is the quintessence of the practice, and we can all be Buddhas because in mundane acts we engage the Buddha in daily life and, from this simple rooting of clarity and mindfulness in the quotidian, we begin to transform the world. With this synoptic, almost holographic, frarnework~ says Hanh, we next understand the Dharma, or basic teaching, is ubiquitous, spoken in manifold tongues. For more than twenty years Hanh has engaged his Buddha nature in the world for our edificaion. He breathed and smiled during wartime Vietnam, when he was chairman of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation., when he founded the Tiep Hien (Interbeing) Order of Buddhism and when he wrote his sixty-six books in Vietnamese, French, and English. His gentle, profound and persuasively true example is flawlessly transmitted in this indefatigably optimistic book, enhanced by the line drawings of Mayumi Oda. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Spirit Song: The Introduction of No-Eyes</h2><p><p>The first volume in a series of books written by Mary Summer Rain about her experiences with an extraordinary Native American shaman called "No-Eyes," <em>Spirit Song</em> has become one of the best-selling and most important books in the literature and philosophy of what has been called the "new-age."</p><p>Mary Summer Rain was the last student of the blind-from-birth Chippewa visionary, and spent many days in the remote cabin in the mountains with the woman who would become her beloved friend and teach her the many lessons of the spirit and of the Earth Mother. But it is the unique interaction between the two that provides the emotional power behind the profound teachings of the old woman. The wonderfully lyrical descriptions of the vivid seasonal beauty of Colorado serve as a backdrop for this unfolding narrative.</p></p><p>These two tapes are volumes 1 &amp; 3 in a set that also includes Phoenix Rising and Phantoms Afoot. No Eyes, a blind Chippewa visionary living in a remote Colorado area and Many Heart, a dreamwalker, are the teachers in this profound journey through the spirit world for Summer Rain. In the Ancient oral tradition they guide the novice along the true path to understanding of who she is and her place in the continuing life of their people. This is a wonderful look at the way knowledge has been passed from generation to generation with strong emphasis on what is good and what might trick the spirituality-seeking novice into taking a wrong path. Positive life is strengthened by the knowledge of the shaman, natural medicine, awareness of Mother Earth and the putting aside the unnecessary quest for things that don't matter, in order to enrich your soul. Beautiful music written and played by Rich Burness on the native flute adds just the right touch to these moving, motivating tapes.

The Marquis de Lafayette stepped ashore to the sound of fifty thousand people cheering wildly, among them the vice president of the United States and two hundred of the city&#x2019;s leading citizens. After a month at sea, the cacophony must have been overwhelming: cannons booming, bells ringing, flags flapping, the West Point band in full swing. Militias stood at attention, wearing Lafayette&#x2019;s portrait over their hearts. Elderly veterans embraced him, openly weeping. Mothers thrust their children into his arms. Men and women fainted. Others approached him so choked with emotion they could not speak. They placed a crown of fresh cypress and laurel boughs on his head and ushered him into a grand carriage drawn by four white horses. The parade proceeded up Broadway to city hall, passing flag-draped buildings and banners stamped with the name of the returning hero, fresh flowers raining down from the windows. The shops were all closed, the business of New York City standing still for the day.1<br><br>As a mere teenager, the Frenchman had joined the Americans in their War for Independence, not only risking his life in battle, but volunteering his own money to feed, clothe, and pay his battalion. His leading role in the Battle of Yorktown had earned him a place in the pantheon of military heroes whose victory brought into being a new nation. Now that nation was nearing its fiftieth anniversary, and Lafayette was back to help celebrate: the only general from the Revolutionary army alive, and still a robust presence a month before his sixty-seventh birthday. But underneath all the patriotic pride was an undeniable note of anxiety.<br><br>The election year of 1824 was the very first in which no founding father appeared on the ticket. From Washington to Monroe, the first five presidents had been active participants in the conception of the new republic, but the country would soon outlive the men who had created it. To survive, it would need to transition from an experimental republic steered and administered directly by its makers to a permanent state, which would require a particular interpretation of its history. Thomas Jefferson had argued that every generation ought to be able to remake American society and all of its laws so that they would not be tyrannically ruled by his generation&#x2019;s dead hand. But by 1824, Americans were looking not for constant reinvention but for stability. Most wanted to believe that the words and deeds of the founders were final and the era of insurrection closed. France loomed as a cautionary tale, having torn up a number of constitutions by this time, its revolution followed by periods of terrible violence, a dictatorship, and finally the restoration of the monarchy in 1814. American society bolstered itself in this troubling changing-of-the-guard moment with a near-religious commemoration of the founding generation&#x2014;a worshipful attitude that Ralph Waldo Emerson would denounce as the tendency to &#x201c;build the sepulcres of the fathers,&#x201d; to be &#x201c;retrospective,&#x201d; or conservative of what had been, rather than following the lead of the founders in daring to imagine what else might be. In short, revolutionary iconoclasm had been replaced with filial piety in American political culture.2<br><br>Lafayette&#x2019;s return was a landmark event in this culture of commemoration. He and his compatriots were to be remembered no longer as militant radicals, high on Enlightenment theory and ready to die for untried ideals, but as patriarchs of a static lineage that must be revered and preserved. While most of the other founders were dead or nearly so, Lafayette still had the physical wherewithal to reassure the American people at a moment when a certain crucial thread threatened to snap. Congress felt it was so important for him to visit at this time that it offered to send a ship to any port in France to convey him to the United States, to live on America&#x2019;s dime for two years, and receive payments in stock and land for his contributions to the revolution, a show of largesse that made the young nation feel strong and rich as its semicentennial Jubilee approached.<br><br>So they rolled out a welcome like no other. Before he left New York, Lafayette was honored by &#x201c;the fete&#x201d; at Castle Garden, which one attendee described as &#x201c;the most brilliant and magnificent scene ever witnessed in the United States.&#x201d; This seems to have been the actual party of the century, a dazzling visual spectacle more lavish than anything anyone present could remember, surpassing even royal coronations. Six thousand partiers with two hundred servants in tow danced the cotillion under an arrangement of chandeliers reflecting the light of a thousand torches. Lafayette went on to tour all twenty-four of the states, paraded around in fine style as the &#x201c;guest of the nation.&#x201d; Wherever he went, he was greeted with festivals, dances, and speeches. Maidens robed in white and wearing crowns of myrtle marched under newly constructed triumphal arches in choreographed formation with engraved lances aloft. They named streets, towns, counties, and city squares for him; at least one newborn was saddled with the name &#x201c;Welcome Lafayette.&#x201d; On one occasion, a young army officer sang some verses he had composed, but when he came to the climax of the song, his voice faltered with emotion and he was unable to say the general&#x2019;s name. He fell at Lafayette&#x2019;s feet crying and rushed away.<br><br>But on the day of his arrival, Lafayette&#x2019;s mind was occupied with thoughts of one woman, who was at that moment still in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean en route to the United States. From the center of the celebratory hubbub, he wrote to a friend how eagerly he awaited the coming ship that would reunite him with his &#x201c;beloved.&#x201d; A month behind his hero&#x2019;s welcome in New York, a far less distinguished vessel pulled in to the harbor with no fanfare, with a woman aboard who was too indispensable to Lafayette to be left out of his American tour but already too controversial to have arrived by the same boat or to be mentioned in any of the official accounts of his visit. As the general&#x2019;s intimate friend, she would soon be entertained in the homes of the nation&#x2019;s first families, only to be regarded in the years to come as the most notorious radical in its history.<br><br>Lafayette was the revolutionary past, but she was the revolutionary future; the press would call her &#x201c;the female Tom Paine.&#x201d; No one worshipped the founders more than she did, and for that very reason she refused to regard their accomplishment as mere symbolism, their rhetoric as empty, or their project complete. In 1824, she was the hushed-up younger woman behind the man who was bringing the country they both idolized to its feet. But within five years, her name would be denounced from pulpits and splashed across the front pages of newspapers, shorthand for a festering fusion of interracial sex, Free Love, gender-bending, and atheism that threatened to bring down the Republic: &#x201c;that she-demon and unprincipled profligate, FANNY WRIGHT.&#x201d;3<br><br>Frances Wright was an orphaned Scottish aristocrat who had been raised, along with her younger sister, Camilla, by a string of relatives in England. She spent most of her youth with an aunt who lived in a twenty-room mansion in a tiny town called Dawlish, on the southern seacoast of Devonshire. When she was seventeen, Wright happened upon a history of the American Revolution in the library of a family member&#x2019;s estate, later recalling how strange it had been to find a &#x201c;subject so politically heterodox&#x201d; in that patrician context. Opening the book had awoken her to &#x201c;a new existence&#x201d; in an instant. &#x201c;From that moment my attention became riveted on this country,&#x201d; she would later write, &#x201c;as on the theater where man might first awake to the full knowledge and the full exercise of his powers.&#x201d; Restless and bored with the limited round of activities available to a genteel young lady under the watch of a persnickety aunt, she began to dream of the United States as a nearly magical new world &#x201c;consecrated to liberty,&#x201d; where traditional constraints and distinctions had been abandoned, and vowed to see it in person one day.4<br><br>Wright went off to live with one of her father&#x2019;s relatives, James Mylne, a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow, a hotbed of the Scottish Enlightenment; her uncle held the faculty position that had once been occupied by Adam Smith. In this environment, Wright imbibed a devotion to reason and empiricism, a suspicion of received wisdom, traditions, and religious authority that would animate her activist career. Women would not be admitted as students at Glasgow until 1883, so Wright&#x2019;s free access to the university library enabled an education that would remain unavailable to other women for generations. She wrote poetry, a philosophical treatise, later a play.</p><h2>The Voice Of The Heart: A Call To Full Living</h2><p>Profoundly insightful, <i>The Voice of the Heart</i> offers a deeper understanding of how to live an abundant life. Chip Dodd teaches us how to begin to know our hearts so that we better know ourselves and are better equipped to live in relationship with others and, ultimately, with God. Included with the book is a audio compact disc. The CD is a companion presentation by Chip Dodd to supplement the material covered in the book. It provides additional teaching on the Spiritual Root System, particularly how feelings play a vital role in our emotional and spiritual maturity.</p><p>How much longer can I do this? Is God good? Is there ever more? What&#x2019;s the point? Dr. Chip Dodd refers to these as questions of the heart in his new book, "The Voice of the Heart: A Call to Full Living" (Sage Hill Resources, a division of Providence Publishing Corporation). Dodd encourages people to examine these questions instead of numbing their hearts with neglect. <p>A full life is beyond our grasp without knowing the eight feelings that are stamped upon our hearts - hurt, loneliness, sadness, anger, fear, shame, guilt, and gladness. For many of us, life is only about survival. Sadly, we live lives of self-protection. We close doors to anything that might lead to hurt or disappointment, only to also shut out our hearts to relationship and all that is joyous and full. </p><p>Profoundly insightful, The Voice of the Heart offers us a deeper understanding of how to live an abundant life. Chip Dodd teaches us how to begin to know our hearts so that we better know ourselves and are better equipped to live in relationship with others and, ultimately, with God. "This book is an invitation to rediscovery," Dodd says. "It helps you to find what you lost and reawaken what is asleep. It will hopefully be a tool to help you knock down the walls around your heart." Dodd believes that the awakening of the heart leads to an abundant life. </p><p>Dodd has spent the past several years developing and teaching the "Spiritual Root System," a metaphor explaining the life of the heart. The system&#x2019;s five roots are feelings, needs, desires, longings, and hope. "The Voice of the Heart" explains all five roots, but the book&#x2019;s emphasis is feelings. "You and I have only eight feelings," Dodd says. "We cannot live in fullness without knowing these feelings. The paradox is that if we choose fullness with our feelings, we also choose to experience pain." The eight feelings Dodd has identified are hurt, loneliness, sadness, anger, fear, shame, guilt, and gladness. </p><p>People often ask Dodd why only one of the feelings&#x2013;gladness&#x2013;is positive. "Each feeling is positive because of where it can lead," he responds. "It&#x2019;s my behavior that is good or bad; feelings themselves are good &#x2014; each feeling is a gift from God." Dodd believes that listening to the feelings of the heart make openness and vulnerability possible, both with other people and with God. Living fully is the goal of life, he says, not being happy all of the time. </p><p>"Ultimately, living fully means more than happiness, comfort, or thrills," Dodd says. "You have the capacity to experience true joy, yet you are equally capable of grieving deeply while holding on to hope. Full life means you can expect great things in the midst of great loss. That&#x2019;s the hope of Jesus."</p>Do you want more out of life? Sage Hill Resources is about reawakening to the dream that life really can be good, full, and rich. It's about entering into an abundant life with all of its joy, pain, and mystery. <p>What's this about? On a practical level, Sage Hill Resources addresses marriage, family, parenting, relationships, and work. But at the same time, it's about so much more. It's about our origin and our destiny - where we've come from, who we are, and who we will be tomorrow. It calls us to acknowledge our heart and embrace the truth that lives within us all. </p><p>Who is this for? Sage Hill Resources is for postmodern searchers exploring who they are and where they are going, the wounded and broken-hearted who want healing to begin, the passionate faithful so busy doing that they have forgotten how to live, and burned-out believers who know there is more to life but don't know where to look. </p><p>What kind of life do you desire? Sage Hill Resources is not about doing more, learning more, or acquiring more. It's about calling each of us to a life of abundance. It's about us stepping into the mystery and beginning to live truthfully out of how we are uniquely and wonderfully made. </p><p>Sage Hill Resources is dedicated to producing materials that deal with matters of the heart: relationship, spiritual growth, and emotional healing. Our products are informed by the Spiritual Root System - a way of understanding how we are made, (as emotional and spiritual creatures in the image of God) and why we are made (for relationship with ourselves, others, and God).</p></p><h2>Technical Readout 3050/Battletech: The Return of Kerensky</h2><p>Details all the new, state-of-the-art BattleMechs, both the improved Inner Sphere &#39;Mechs and those used by the Clans.

But I didn&#x2019;t have enormous talent. Some people believed I did because I wrote poems and was shy, didn&#x2019;t make eye contact, kept to myself. (Nowadays you&#x2019;d say &#x201c;high-functioning end of the autism spectrum,&#x201d; but back in the day oddity was interpreted differently.). Anyway, death didn&#x2019;t occur. I never needed to charter a plane in a snowstorm as Buddy did, and a car like James Dean&#x2019;s Porsche 550 Spyder was way beyond my means, and heroin was not readily available in Anoka, Minnesota, so onward I went. I had a lot to think about other than immortality&#x2014;sex, of course, and how to avoid going to Vietnam and dying young in a stupid war, and then I started a radio show called A Prairie Home Companion, which ate up all my time&#x2014;a man has to work awfully hard to make up for lack of talent&#x2014;and suddenly I was forty, which is too old to die young, so I forgot about it and headed down the long dirt road of longevity, and thus arrived at seventy, when I took time to sit down and read my own work and see what is what.</p><p>I started out with No. 2 pencil and pads of paper, then acquired an Underwood manual typewriter with a faint f and a misshapen O. You had to poke the keys hard to make an impression. I set it on a maple desk in my bedroom, which looked out onto a cornfield across the road, and I wrote stories about tortured loners who stood at a distance from the crowd and observed their comings and goings with envy tinged with contempt. Or contempt tinged with envy. My parents did not encourage literary aspirations: I was the third of six children of John and Grace, a young Sanctified Brethren couple in Anoka, Minnesota, on the Mississippi, a farm boy and a city girl who eloped and married secretly against opposition from both their families. We have a premarital picture of them on a summer day in a backyard in Minneapolis, looking very dreamy. The Brethren did not read novels or poetry and were wary of history, except what was in Scripture, but they offered a rich supply of contempt. They were the Faithful Remnant, maintaining the pure flame of God&#x2019;s Word abandoned by the rest of Christianity. I grew up along the river in Brooklyn Park township, where we moved in 1947 into a house Dad built on an acre lot with room for a big garden. All around us were vegetable farms, fields of corn, peas, onions, potatoes. My brother and sister and I attended Benson School, a handsome three-room country school, where I had Estelle Shaver and Fern Moehlenbrock for teachers. In first grade, I was slow to read, and Miss Shaver kept me after school to read aloud to her, which she made me believe was not for my sake, but for hers, to keep her company as she graded papers. She said to Bill the janitor, &#x201c;Listen to him, doesn&#x2019;t he have a lovely voice.&#x201d; In time, I turned into a bookworm and a good speller. At age eleven, after I dropped an easy fly ball during recess, I asked Miss Moehlenbrock&#x2019;s permission to spend recess in the library, reading history books, a turning point in my life. Instead of vying for the respect of other boys, I sought out the company of old uncles and asked them about the war and the thirties and why did Grandpa Denham come over from Scotland in 1905 and why did Grandpa Keillor come down from New Brunswick in 1880? The old uncles were very grateful for a boy&#x2019;s interest. All I had to do was ask a few questions and sit and listen. They thought I was definitely gifted. It was so much easier to ingratiate myself with them than to impress my peers. My peers thought I was strange. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I won the class spelling bee that spring, beating out Billy Pedersen on the word veracity.</p><p>The summer before eighth grade, I walked into the office of the Anoka Herald, a down-at-the-heels weekly around the corner from the junior high, and asked the editor, Warren Feist, if I could write sports for him, assuming he&#x2019;d laugh and say no. It was an act of reckless bravery by a fearful young man, and Mr. Feist was very kind. He smiled and said, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; So I got to sit in the press box at football games, high above the crowd, and look reporterly as I took extensive notes on each play. Back at the office&#x2014;thirteen years old, I had an office&#x2014;Whitey and Russ sat at the keyboards of their monster Linotype machines, with a little flame in back keeping the melted lead hot. Line by line, they clattered away at the stories, pulling the lever that poured the hot lead into the mold to make a slug. I banged out my stories and handed the yellow copy paper to Russ, who typeset them. He and Whitey were both heavy drinkers, pasty-faced with purple noses, and the paper languished in the shadow of the competing County Union. But I was thrilled to be there. Mr. Feist edited my stories gently, removing paragraphs of crowd description, drawing out the action on the field. The Herald was printed on Wednesday afternoon and I made a point to be there to watch. Whitey stood on a platform over the flatbed press and, though he was drunk, he could take a sheet of paper the size of a cafeteria table, shake it loose from the stack, and then flip it up and onto the flatbed, where the roller rolled over it with a whump and a shwoosh and the folder cut and trimmed and folded it, and a copy of the Herald slid down the chute with the sports page and my name, my story about the Anoka Tornadoes ready to be read by dozens, if not hundreds, of subscribers, men and women in kitchens all over Anoka absorbed in my account of the game. It was thrilling then and still is, years later, seeing your own words in print.</p><p>My parents were dismayed by newspapering. My mother said that writers were a bunch of drunks, meaning F. Scott Fitzgerald. As a young woman, she had lived near his old neighborhood in St. Paul and heard stories. She also knew that Hemingway, Faulkner, O&#x2019;Neill, Tennessee Williams, and Dylan Thomas all drank a lot. People went to Thomas&#x2019;s readings to see if he could remain standing and not drop a cigarette down his pants and set himself on fire. She had read about that somewhere.</p><p>As Sanctified Brethren born and bred, they were not sympathetic to the writing life. They cleaved to the literal truth of Holy Scripture and pored over the Word, trying to discern the Lord&#x2019;s Will. That was the writing that mattered and everything else was vanity and horsefeathers. The Lord wanted us to be watchful, waiting for His Glorious Return, not making up stories. We sat in the Gospel Hall on Fourteenth Avenue South in Minneapolis, perusing Deuteronomy, led by my Uncle Don, who felt that God&#x2019;s instructions to the Jews wandering in the wilderness had relevance for us. The Bible was awfully exciting to read if you believed it was entirely true&#x2014;as great literature, it was not bad, but as revelation, it was a wild ride. I was a devout young man, at least in my own heart, and asked to be baptized when I was fourteen, and waded out into the waters with Brother John Rogers as the Brethren sang a hymn. When I was twenty, I abandoned them. I thought that probably they were right, that it was sinful to want to be a writer, but I wanted to do it anyway. It was all I really wanted. A good Christian was supposed to sacrifice his desires to the Lord. I chose not to.</p><p>In 1960 I went off to be an English major at the University of Minnesota, where John Berryman, James Wright, and Allen Tate taught. My parents were not pleased, but I didn&#x2019;t ask for their help and so they had no say about it. I owned three cardboard boxes of stuff including a Webster&#x2019;s Third Unabridged and an Underwood typewriter. Hiking around campus in blue jeans, white shirt, corduroy jacket with elbow patches, Red Wing work boots, and a broad-brimmed hat, with a pack of Camels or Marlboros in my pocket, I felt obliged to smoke at least one pack of cigarettes every day, two if I could afford them, and drink coffee by the gallon, because that&#x2019;s what writers do. Back then, a cup of coffee was two bits, a pack of smokes cost 35 cents, and a drink was a dollar. I supported myself by washing dishes and parking cars, both of them formative experiences. You work the morning shift in the heat and steam of the scullery and you feel clean and contented the rest of the day. You stand on a gravel parking lot on the high bluff of the Mississippi, the wintry blast sweeping down the valley, and you direct a stream of cars to their correct spots in straight lines, tolerating no dissent or diversion, stomping out individual preference wherever it occurs, and you discover the fascist storm trooper within yourself. Good to know one&#x2019;s own capacity.</p><p>Mr. Tate was sixty-eight when I took his poetry seminar. A slim, elegant man with a Southern patrician accent&#x2014;a pal of Robert Penn Warren and Hart Crane&#x2014;he chain-smoked in class, so we did, too. The whole English Department reeked of tobacco smoke and was proudly alcoholic&#x2014; anyone who wasn&#x2019;t was considered an interloper, possibly a Mormon. James Wright chain-smoked through his lectures on Dickens and Whitman, which he delivered through a haze of hangover. He always looked pale and haggard. His line &#x201c;Suddenly I realize that if I stepped out of my body, I would break into blossom&#x201d; was written by a man with smoke coming out of his mouth.</p><p>My hero, Saul Bellow (The Adventures of Augie March), had recently taught at the U and I liked hearing about him from his pal, my advisor, Joe Kwiat, a big, hearty guy with a great bark of a voice. Snowy-haired Robert Frost came and filled Northrup Auditorium, 4,700 seats, and recited his greatest hits by heart. I was in a crowd of students who stood by the back door and watched him emerge and shuffle down the walk and climb into his limousine. Our great drunken genius was John Berryman, the poet and wildly brilliant lecturer, a man of such towering intellect that I was afraid to be in the same room with him&#x2014;one caustic word, even a disapproving glance, and I would&#x2019;ve gone up in flames. He wore a big beard that made him look like he was eating his sweater. He gave readings of his Dream Songs at which his speech was slurred, he slumped against the lectern, lurching into flights of reminiscence, muttering asides to friends in the audience, a man on the verge of collapse. His greatness and his affliction seemed intertwined, a true artist engaging with dark forces in his own body in full public view. Fate had driven him to this condition, just as it had driven him to create poetry, and he could no more give up one than he could stifle the other. And I, fearful of embarrassing myself in public, was clearly incapable of this greatness.</p><p>If the true sign of brilliance is to be seriously screwed up, stalked by livid demons, fatally wounded, then I was, compared to Berryman, a dullard and a dolt. My dad had not committed suicide with a shotgun outside my bedroom window when I was twelve. Berryman&#x2019;s had. Mine simply worked hard. My boyhood may have appeared strict and narrow&#x2014;no dancing, drinking, smoking, moviegoing, card playing, no rough talk or profanity&#x2014;but my Brethren were people of great kindness, most of them related to me. I was quite at home among them.</p><p>So I accepted that I would never be a true artist and that my future lay in being amusing. For the campus literary magazine, The Ivory Tower, I wrote stuff that owed much to Benchley and Thurber, A. J. Liebling and E. B. White. My journalism teacher, Bob Lindsay, encouraged this. He was a Marine Corps captain&#x2014;a veteran of two wars, his bald head had a noticeable dent in it, as if a mortar shell had bounced off it&#x2014;and he was a no-nonsense teacher. In his class, one spelling mistake on a writing assignment, no matter how elegant, earned you an F. We were horrified to hear this. But we learned to copyread, a skill that sticks with you for life. Mr. Lindsay&#x2019;s office was on the first floor of Murphy Hall, and whenever I walked down the hall, I slowed down, and if his door was open and he didn&#x2019;t have a visitor, I stuck my head in. He was brusque, not given to b.s., and when he said I should try to catch on at The New Yorker, that was pure gold. And then, unbeknownst to me, he sent the magazine a few pieces of mine from the Tower and a letter attesting to my good character.</p><p>I had not told him that I had written to my draft board and said I would not report for induction into the U.S. Army, as I&#x2019;d been ordered to do. Vietnam was on every young man&#x2019;s mind and I waited for the FBI to knock on my door and they didn&#x2019;t. Evidently someone at the draft board office stuck my file in a dark place and thereby put herself in danger&#x2014;it is a felony to conceal or otherwise impair the availability of a governmental record&#x2014;and whoever did that deed was braver than I. I owe her a large debt and wish I knew who she is.</p><p>In 1966, I spent July and August in New York, holed up in a boarding-house on West Nineteethth Street in a poor Hispanic neighborhood near the Episcopal seminary, and thought about staying permanently. The boardinghouse was cheap: breakfast and dinner along with a room for $75 a week. The clientele was about half recent patients from mental hospitals, doped up on Thorazine, a quiet bunch, who sat in the garden under ailanthus trees listening to the nuns in a nearby convent chanting in Spanish. I was supposed to marry a girl in September, a big wedding in a Methodist church with four bridesmaids in bronze taffeta and country-club reception&#x2014;it was all planned&#x2014;and I wanted to escape. I felt like a jerk, abandoning her and her family, who had been so good to me, but I was hearing warning bells&#x2014;there was a large vacancy between her and me. New York seemed like a good move, what with marriage and the FBI way on my trail. I knew an artist named Irving who drove a cab by night and shot photographs by day, and I hung out with him. He was screwed up, as a true artist should be, he dropped acid, smoked dope, and lived in a one-bedroom fourth-floor walk-up on the Lower East Side with his wife and two baby girls in such poverty as I knew I hadn&#x2019;t the strength of character to endure. Tiny dim rooms, summer heat, city clangor, sink full of dirty dishes, weeping infants, a bitter wife. New York was a dark swamp where a man could walk deeper and deeper into the muck and disappear and nobody would notice. But what was waiting for me back in Minnesota? I tried to write a piece for The New Yorker that romanticized life on Nineteenth Street as operatic, flamboyant, exotic, people yelling at each other in Spanish, and took it to their offices on West Forty-third, where a very nice woman named Patricia Mosher read it and told me to keep in touch. I took a bus to Boston to interview at the Atlantic. An overnight bus, to save on hotel. Got to the Atlantic office on Arlington Street an hour early and went to the men&#x2019;s toilet, stood at the sink, took off my shirt, and sort of bathed and dried myself with paper towels, and a man in a suit came in, stood at the urinal, and made a point of not looking at me. He, as it turned out, was the man who would be interviewing me.

But White's marine biologist Doc Ford is a much more complicated character than the late, great John D. MacDonald's muscular bounty hunter. For one thing, Ford has a shadowy political past--which explains why he's reluctant to race down to Havana to bail out his chemically-abusive friend Tomlinson when his boat is impounded under suspicious circumstances. "By most definitions it was a nightmare, but to me it was simply a sleeping revisitation of a thing I had done, a thing that I loathed," says Doc--planting the seeds of a revelation about his past and showing off the kind of writing that makes his new book so compulsively readable.RANDY WAYNE WHITE is the author of the Doc Ford novels including <em>Night Moves</em>, <em>Chasing Midnight</em>, <em>Night Vision</em>, and <em>Deep Shadow</em> and the Hannah Smith novel, <em>Gone</em>, the first in a new series.

In this page-turning, breathtaking novel, the characters will walk off the page and into your life.

When an attractive bungalow comes available on county auction for a fraction of its value, he sees a great opportunity for himself, his wife, and his children. But the house's former owner, a recovering alcoholic and addict down on her luck, doesn't see it that way, nor does her lover, a married cop driven to extremes to win her love and get her house back.<br><br><em>House of Sand and Fog</em> is a narrative triumph in which a traditional immigrant success story and a modern love story are turned upside down with brutal, heartrending consequences. It is an American tragedy, and a shockingly true picture of the country we live in today.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, November 2000:</b> Andre Dubus III wastes no time in capturing the dark side of the immigrant experience in America at the end of the 20th century. <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> opens with a highway crew composed of several nationalities picking up litter on a hot California summer day. Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, reflects on his job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four years before: "I have spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the correct waiting time; but there is nothing." The father of two, Behrani has spent most of the money he brought with him from Iran on an apartment and furnishings that are too expensive, desperately trying to keep up appearances in order to enhance his daughter's chances of making a good marriage. Now the daughter is married, and on impulse he sinks his remaining funds into a house he buys at auction, thus unwittingly putting himself and his family on a trajectory to disaster. The house, it seems, once belonged to Kathy Nicolo, a self-destructive alcoholic who wants it back. What starts out as a legal tussle soon escalates into a personal confrontation--with dire results. <p> Dubus tells his tragic tale from the viewpoints of the two main adversaries, Behrani and Kathy. To both of them, the house represents something more than just a place to live. For the colonel, it is a foot in the door of the American dream; for Kathy, a reminder of a kinder, gentler past. In prose that is simple yet evocative, <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> builds to its inevitable denouement, one that is painfully dark but unfailingly honest. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><i>House of Sand and Fog</i> has been named a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award in Fiction.</p><h2>Hosts</h2><p>Repairman Jack has been tearing up the urban adventure scene ever since he was introduced in the New York Times bestseller The Tomb. As his fans know, Repairman Jack doesn't deal with electronic appliances; he's a situation fixer, no matter how weird or deadly a situation may be. Repairman Jack has no last name, no Social Security number, and no qualms when it comes to getting the job done-even if it means putting himself in serious danger.<br><br>After fifteen years of separation, Jack is contacted by his long-lost sister, Kate, to help her track down the source of her girlfriend Jeanette's sudden trance-like behavior. Referred by a mysterious stranger who gives only Jack's name and phone number, Kate is shocked to find out that the "repairman" she seeks is none other than her little brother-and not altogether happy to find out what little "Jackie" has been doing with himself for all these years. With Jack leading the way, Kate finds out that Jeannette's behavior can be traced back to the experimental therapy she underwent for a brain tumor: now Jeannette's brain and those of several other subjects are infected by a mutated virus. Like any good virus, it wants to multiply-and if Jack can't stop the virus in its path, there will be deadly results. <br><br>Meanwhile, Jack is traveling on the 9 train when suddenly a passenger goes berserk and starts shooting at random-leaving Jack no choice but to throw himself into the spotlight by putting the shooter down. Worse for Jack, one of his fellow passengers is a reporter for the local tabloid, The Light, who sees Jack's heroism as his ticket to journalistic stardom. The reporter promises to make Jack a celebrity hero, a household name-which could mean the end of Repairman Jack as we know him.<br></p><p>F. Paul Wilson, a<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of horror, adventure, medical thrillers, science fiction, and virtually everything in between, is a practicing physician who resides in Wall, New Jersey.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Kate Iverson stared out the window of the hurtling taxi and wondered where she was. New York was not her town. She knew certain sections, and if it were daytime she might have had some idea as to her location, but here in the dark and fog she could have been anywhere.<br>She'd started the trip thirty minutes and who-knew-how-many miles ago in the West Twenties with a follow-that-cab scenario--<i>I still can't believe I really said that</i>--that moved across town and up the FDR Drive. The East River had served as a comforting landmark for a while, but as twilight had faded to night, the river fell behind, replaced by dark shapes and fuzzy lights looming in the fog beyond the roadway.<br>"What road is this?" she asked the driver.<br>Through the Plexiglas barrier came the accented reply, double-rolling the r's: "Bruckner Expressway." The driver's ID tag showed a dark mustached face with glowering black eyes and indicated he was Mustafah Salaam.<br>She'd often heard "the Bruckner" mentioned in the incessant traffic reports on New York City radio but had no idea where it was.<br>"This is Bronx," the driver added, anticipating her next question.<br>Kate felt a quick stab of fear. The Bronx? Visions of burned-out buildings and rubble-strewn lots swirled through her brain.<br>Oh, Jeanette, she thought, staring ahead at the cab they were following, where are you going? Where are you taking me?<br>Kate had stashed her two teenagers with her ex and taken a short leave from her pediatric group practice in Trenton to stay with Jeanette during her recovery from brain tumor therapy. The experimental treatment had been a resounding success. No ill effects...at least none that would be apparent to Jeanette's treating physician.<br>But since completion of the treatment, Kate had noticed a definite personality change. The Jeanette Vega she'd come to know and deeply love over these past two years was a warm, giving person, full of enthusiasm for life, with an opinion about everything. A delightfully edgy chatterbox. But slowly she had changed. The new Jeanette was cold and distant, rarely speaking unless spoken to, leaving her apartment without a word about where she was going, disappearing for hours at a time.<br>At first Kate had chalked it up to an acute reactive depression. Why not? What medical diagnosis can rock the foundations of your world more deeply than an inoperable malignant brain tumor? But depression didn't quite explain her behavior. When Jeanette should have been depressed--when she'd been told she had a literal death sentence growing in her brain--she'd remained her upbeat self. Now, after a miraculous cure, after regaining her whole future, she'd become another person.<br>Maybe it was a stress reaction.<br>Or a side effect of the treatment. As a physician Kate prided herself on keeping current with medical progress, so she was familiar with medicine's cutting edge; but the experimental protocol that had saved Jeanette seemed damn near science fiction.<br>Yet it had worked. The tumor was dead, and Jeanette would live on.<br>But would she live on without Kate?<br>That, Kate admitted, was what was really disturbing her. Nearing middle age--in darn good shape for forty-four, she knew, but still six years older than Jeanette--she couldn't help worrying that Jeanette had found someone else. Someone younger.<br>That would be so unlike the old Jeanette. But this new Jeanette...who could say?<br>Jeanette had been put on notice that her remaining time on earth was numbered in months instead of decades; she'd believed she'd seen her last Christmas tree, tasted her last Thanksgiving dinner. And then it was all given back to her. How could anyone's psyche survive that sort of trauma unscathed?<br>Perhaps the ordeal had caused Jeanette tos reassess her life. Maybe she'd looked around and asked, <i>Is this what I want</i>? And perhaps, in some new back-from-the-brink perspective, she'd decided she wanted something else. More. Different.<br>At least she could tell me, Kate thought. She owes me that much.<br>Jeanette hadn't asked her to leave--she had the right since it was her apartment--but she had moved out of the bedroom they'd always shared on Kate's visits and into the study where she slept on the couch. No amount of questioning from Kate had elicited a reason why.<br>The not knowing gnawed at her. So tonight, when Jeanette had walked out the door without a word, Kate had followed.<br>Never in a million years would she have imagined herself trailing the woman she loved through the night. But things change. It hadn't been all that long ago that she never would have imagined herself loving another woman.<br>Up ahead, Jeanette's cab turned off the Bruckner and Kate's followed it onto a road the signs identified as the Bronx River Parkway. And after a few miles the city suddenly disappeared and they were in the woods--in the Bronx?<br>"Stay closer," she told the driver. "You're letting them get too far ahead."<br>She didn't want to come all this way just to lose her.<br>Then Kate saw signs for the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Gardens. More turns, each new road smaller than the last until they were traveling a tree-lined residential street.<br>"Are we still in the Bronx?" she asked, marveling at all the well-kept homes trailing by on either side.<br>"Still Bronx, yes," the driver told her.<br>How come it never looks like this on TV? she wondered.<br>"Keep going," Kate said when she saw Jeanette's cab pull into the curb before a neat brick colonial.<br>Her anxiety soared as a thousand questions cascaded through her mind. Who lived there? Another woman?<br>She had the driver stop half a block beyond. She watched Jeanette's cab leave her on the sidewalk and pull away. As Jeanette started up the walk toward the house, Kate opened her own cab's door.<br>"Wait here," she said.<br>"No-no," the driver said. "You must pay."<br>Nice neighborhood or not, this was still the Bronx, and a long way from Jeanette's apartment. Kate did not want to be stranded here. She glanced at the meter and fished the exact amount out of her wallet.<br>"Here," she said, keeping her voice low as she handed him the money. "You'll get your tip when we get back to the city."<br>He seemed to accept that, nodding without comment as he took the money.<br>She pulled her raincoat tightly around her. A chilly night for June. The fog was thinning and the wet street glistened in the glow from the streetlights; every sound seemed amplified. Kate was glad she'd worn sneakers as she padded along the street, keeping the parked cars between her and Jeanette.<br>When she'd approached as close as she dared, she stopped behind a tree trunk and watched Jeanette walk up the front steps of the house. Kate's heart ached at the sight of her: a yellow rain slicker and loose jeans hid her feminine curves; a Yankees cap hid much of her straight, jet black hair, but Kate knew those curves, remembered the strawberry scent of the shampoo Jeanette used to wash that hair.<br>Suddenly Kate wished she hadn't come. Who was going to open that door? Forty minutes ago she'd been dying to know, now she was terrified. But she couldn't turn away. Especially not now, because the door was opening and a man stood there, a heavyset fiftyish man with a round face and small eyes and a balding melon head. He smiled and opened his arms and Jeanette embraced him.<br>Kate's stomach lurched.<br>A man? Not Jeanette! Anyone but Jeanette! It simply wasn't in her!<br>Stunned, she watched Jeanette follow him inside. No, this couldn't be. Kate moved out from behind her tree and approached the house. Her sneaker slipped on a wet tree root and she nearly fell, but kept going, stumbling on until she reached the foot of the front stoop. She saw the name <i>Holdstock</i> on the mailbox and fought a mad urge to hammer on the door.<br>Then she noticed silhouettes moving back and forth within the front windows. More than two. What was going on in there?<br>Kate started toward the nearer of the two windows but changed her mind. Too much light out here. Wouldn't do to have a neighbor pass by and catch her peeking in. She backed away and moved around to the shadowed side of the house. There she crouched between a pair of azalea bushes and peered through the screen into the Holdstock living room.<br>Six...seven--no, eight people in the room. Three men, five women, of varying ages, shapes, and sizes, all taking turns embracing Jeanette as if she were a long-lost relative. And Jeanette was smiling--oh, God, how Kate missed that smile, Days since she'd seen it, days that felt like a lifetime.<br>An odd group. And even odder that no one seemed to be speaking. Not a word. Apparently they'd been waiting for Jeanette, for immediately after greeting her they all seated themselves in the circle of chairs set up around the room. And still no one spoke. Everyone seemed to know what to do: they joined hands, closed their eyes, let their heads fall back...and smiled. Jeanette and all the rest wore beatific smiles, so full of peace and contentment that Kate, for an instant, envied them. They looked as if they were viewing God herself.<br>And then they began to hum. Not a transcendental "oum," this was a single note, and it went on and on, without a trace of harmony. Everyone humming the same note.<br>What are you into, Jeanette? A prayer group? Is that what's happened? Your old pantheism couldn't handle a malignant glioma so now you've joined some rapturous fundamentalist sect?<br>Kate heard a sob and realized it had come from her. She sagged against the bricks, weak with relief.<br>This I can handle this I can deal with. As long as you don't reject me...us...what we've built over the years, I know we can come through this.<br>She backed away from the window, turning when she reached the front lawn. She gasped as she found a woman standing not two feet away.<br>"You have had fears, and now they are eased, yes?" A deep voice with a Russian accent.<br>She looked middle-aged and wore a white hooded cape that fell below her knees. Dark hair framed her face. Kate stepped back when she saw the big white dog standing at her side. It looked like some sort of husky. Its eyes reflected light from the street as it stared at her, but she sensed no hostility.<br>"You startled me," Kate stammered, not sure how to explain her presence here. "I...I was just--"<br>"You think is perhaps religious group? At worst a cult, yes?" Her dark eyes flashed, her lipsticked gash of a mouth tightened into a thin line as she raised a crooked index finger; she used it to emphasize her words by jabbing it at Kate. "Not cult. Worse than cult. Much worse. If you wish to save the loves of your life you must stop them."<br>"What?" Kate said, baffled. What was she talking about? "I can't--"<br>"Of course not. You will need help. Here is number to call." Her other hand wormed from under the cape and held out a card.<br>Kate hesitated, not knowing what to make of this woman. She seemed composed but her patter was paranoid. And yet...she seemed to know about her...and Jeanette.<br>"Take it," the woman said, thrusting the card at her. "And do not waste time. Time is short. Call him tonight. No one else...only him."<br>Kate squinted at the card in the dim light. Getting so hard to read lately--the price to pay for passing forty--and her glasses were tucked away in her bag. She pushed the card to arm's length and angled it for a better view. A phone number and a name, handwritten in an old-fashioned cursive style. She couldn't make out the number but the name was written larger: <i>Jack</i>.<br>That was it--no last name, no address, just...Jack.<br>"Who--?"<br>She looked up and found herself alone. She hurried out to the sidewalk but the woman and her dog were nowhere to be seen, vanished as if they'd never been.<br>Am I going crazy? she wondered. But the card in her hand was real.<br>The woman's words echoed back to her: <i>If you wish to save the loves of your life</i>...<br>She'd said loves, hadn't she? Yes, Kate was sure of it...the woman had used the plural. Kate could think of only three loves in her life: Jeanette, of course, but even before her came Kevin and Elizabeth.<br>Something twisted in Kate's chest at the thought of her children being in some sort of danger...needing to be <i>saved</i>.<br>But how could that be possible? Kevin and Lizzie were safe in Trenton with their father. And what possible danger could the hand-holding, regular middle-class folks in the Holdstock living room pose to her children?<br>Still the mere hint from someone, even an addled stranger, that they might be in danger jangled Kate's nerves. Danger from what? Attack? They were both teenagers now, but that didn't mean they couldn't be molested.<br>She glanced back at the house and thought she saw a curtain move in one of the front windows. Had one of the worshipers or whatever they were been watching her?<br>This was too creepy. As she turned and hurried back toward her waiting cab, more of the old woman's words pursued her.<br><i>And do not waste time. Time is short. Call him tonight</i>.<br>Kate looked at the card. Jack. Who was he? Where was he?<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2001 by F.

As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet&#x2019;s signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a profession." He went on to not only fulfill his dream but to introduce generations of young readers to his delightful vision of humor, friendship and compassion.<br>&#34;Witty, original, with divine animal characters.&#34; Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The Odd Woman and the City: A Memoir</h2><p><p><b>A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, Autobiography</b></p><p><b>A contentious, deeply moving ode to friendship, love, and urban life in the spirit of </b><i><b>Fierce Attachments</b></i></p><p>A memoir of self-discovery and the dilemma of connection in our time, <i>The Odd Woman and the City</i> explores the rhythms, chance encounters, and ever-changing friendships of urban life that forge the sensibility of a fiercely independent woman who has lived out her conflicts, not her fantasies, in a city (New York) that has done the same. Running steadily through the book is Vivian Gornick's exchange of more than twenty years with Leonard, a gay man who is sophisticated about his own unhappiness, whose friendship has "shed more light on the mysterious nature of ordinary human relations than has any other intimacy" she has known. The exchange between Gornick and Leonard acts as a Greek chorus to the main action of the narrator's continual engagement on the street with grocers, derelicts, and doormen; people on the bus, cross-dressers on the corner, and acquaintances by the handful. In Leonard she sees herself reflected plain; out on the street she makes sense of what she sees.<br> Written as a narrative collage that includes meditative pieces on the making of a modern feminist, the role of the <i>flaneur </i>in urban literature, and the evolution of friendship over the past two centuries, <i>The Odd Woman and the City </i>beautifully bookends Gornick's acclaimed <i>Fierce Attachments</i>, in which we first encountered her rich relationship with the ultimate metropolis.</p></p><p><b>Vivian Gornick</b> is the bestselling author of the acclaimed memoir <i>Fierce Attachments</i>, a biography of Emma Goldman, and three essay collections: <i>The Men in My Life</i>, <i>Approaching Eye Level</i>, and <i>The End of the Novel of Love</i>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.<p>&#x201c;[F]unny and elegiac and truth-dealing. . . .

But equally important are questions of who was actually fighting this war and what they were actually doing.<br><br><i>Out of Control</i> supplies the answer. Leslie Cockburn has been following the trail of Lieut. Col. Oliver North and his secret army since 1984 as a producer for CBS News. In the course of innumerable trips to Central America and elsewhere, she found the foot soldiers of this secret army and the men who controlled them. They told of an arms pipeline running directly from the United States to the front lines of the contra war. They told of a contra leadership more interested in their own personal welfare than in fighting the war. They told of plots to provoke direct United States military intervention in Nicaragua. They told of secret meetings to plan assassinations. Most shockingly of all, members of the network laid out the intimate connection between the secret army and narcotics, and how the very same people had been simultaneously shipping arms, shipping drugs, and receiving subsidies of United States taxpayers' money.<br><br>The American people did not know about these activities. American government agencies did know, and strove to prevent the facts from being revealed.<br><br><i>Out of Control</i> tells how people risked careers, liberty, and their lives to try to reveal the truth. Some of these people paid a bitter price, abandoned by superiors who found their knowledge inconvenient and embarrassing. At least one of them paid the ultimate price.<br><br>As the story moves between the jungles of Central America, the Miami underworld, and Washington, D.C., we learn for the first time the extraordinary details of the secret war in Nicaragua.</p><p>Recent works like John Prados's Presidents' Secret Wars ( LJ 2/15/87) and Gregory Treverton's Covert Action (Basic Books, 1987) show that "the secret government" is no aberration, as the report of the Iran-contra hearings suggested, but an entrenched, pervasive, institutionalized way of life. CBS news producer Cockburn provides even more evidence in this fascinating and troubling account of the covert war in Central America and its connection to the drug trade. She takes up where the Iran-contra hearings left off, or more precisely did not choose to tread, and traces the story of this ugly war from the mud and blood of the La Penca killings to the highest corridors of power in Washington.

Robert Ferguson is a sure guide across what he calls &#39;the treacherous marches which divide legend from fact in Viking Age history&#39;. His long familiarity with the literary culture of Scandinavia - the eddas, the poetry of the skalds and the sagas - is combined with the latest archaeological discoveries and the evidence of picture-stones, runes, ships and objects scattered all over northern Europe, to make the most convincing modern portrait of the Viking Age in any language. The Hammer and the Cross ranges from Scandinavia itself to Kievan Rus and Byzantium in the east, to Iceland, Greenland and the north American settlements in the west. Beyond its geographical boundaries the book takes us on a journey to a misty region inhabited by Hallfred the Troublesome Poet, Harald Bluetooth, Ragnar Hairy-Breeches, Ivar the Boneless and Eyvind the Plagiarist, in which literature, history and myth dissolve into one another.</p><p>Robert Ferguson is one of the world&#39;s leading scholars in Scandinavian studies. After studying in London under Peter Foote, co-author of the classic Viking Achievement, he emigrated to Norway in 1984. At the invitation of the Norwegian Government he has lectured on aspects of Norwegian and Scandinavian history and culture at embassies, universities and other cultural venues in St Petersburg, New Delhi, Mumbai, Oslo, Bergen, Prague, Warsaw, Riga, Edinburgh, Vasa, New York and at the Library of Congress in Washington. His previous books include biographies of Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun.Sporting monikers such as Sven Forkbeard and Harald Bluetooth, the Vikings left arresting traces in saga and chronicle, in addition to their signature destruction and massacre. Ferguson synthesizes Viking scholarship for a general audience and follows the Vikings wherever they went. Spreading from Scandinavia, they entered written records as a result of raids on Britain and Ireland in the late 700s; soon the divisive Carolingian empire, and the land that would become Russia, would experience the Viking scourge as well. But along with slaves and booty came the encounter with Christianity, among whose proselytizers numbered the fearless believers who brought the Gospel to worshippers of Odin and Thor. The pagan-Christian interface informs Ferguson&#x2019;s narrative, and by emphasizing experiences of the conversion process by identifiable individuals within a centuries-long direction of Vikings forsaking their old religion, the author textures the pillage that he asserts is necessary to a complete understanding of the Viking age. Integrating archaeological, genetic, linguistic, and literary information, Ferguson realizes a Viking history bound to satisfy the interested reader. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Sexes and Genealogies</h2><p>In the tradition of Simone de Beauvoir and Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray is one of France's most versatile feminist critics. <i>Sexes and Genealogies, </i>a collection of lectures delivered throughout Canada and Europe, introduces her writing to a wider American audience.<br><br>Irigaray's most famous work, <i>Speculum of the Other Woman, </i>prompted her expulsion from the Lacanin Ecole Freudienne because of its searing depiction of Platonic and Freudian representations of women.

So within these pages, the popular monks of Cambridge, NY, offer useful suggestions for mastering the elusive art of happiness. And while this might sound like a book written by jolly Friar Tucks, it is in fact an intelligent, informed discussion on the soothing power of prayer, mercy, compassion, and devotion. It also opens the doors to the private life of monastic living--helping readers to see that even nuns and monks experience rapture as well as doubt and despair.<p> In most of their chapters, the monks speak to the principles of spiritual happiness, such as "The Discipline of Change," "Practice Sacred Reading," and "River of Mercy." Interspersed with these lively and useful chapters, the monks have inserted seven "Interludes" in which they speak about monastic living. The result is a thoroughly satisfying package, filled with advice, reflection, warm personal anecdotes, and a delicious taste of what it means to live the contemplative life. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>&#34;The Monks of New Skete have lived as a community in Cambridge, New York, for more than thirty years.

Now, the power of Diop&#x2019;s acclaimed novel is available to English-speaking readers through Fiona Mc Laughlin&#x2019;s crisp translation. The novel recounts the story of a Rwandan history teacher, Cornelius Uvimana, who was living and working in Djibouti at the time of the massacre. He returns to Rwanda to try to comprehend the death of his family and to write a play about the events that took place there. As the novel unfolds, Cornelius begins to understand that it is only our humanity that will save us, and that as a writer, he must bear witness to the atrocities of the genocide.</p><p>From the novel:<br>"If only by the way people are walking, you can see that tension is mounting by the minute. I can feel it almost physically. Everyone is running or at least hurrying about. I meet more and more passersby who seem to be walking around in circles. There seems to be another light in their eyes. I think of the fathers who have to face the anguished eyes of their children and who can&#x2019;t tell them anything. For them, the country has become an immense trap in the space of just a few hours. Death is on the prowl. They can&#x2019;t even dream of defending themselves.

Detective Sigurdur �li is questioning his life&#x2019;s direction after learning that Iceland&#x2019;s recent prosperity (soon to disappear following the debt-crisis-fueled collapse) has made several of his schoolmates wealthy, and his long-term relationship becomes a casualty of the emotional distance his job requires. When his friend Patrekur asks him to unofficially discourage a blackmailer, he&#x2019;s uncomfortable with violating regulations but reluctantly agrees. Unfortunately, when his visit interrupts a murder attempt on the extortionist, there&#x2019;s no chance of hiding his involvement from the department. Suspicion falls on Patrekur, and Sigurdur scrambles to restore his unblemished record by proving he&#x2019;s not an unwitting alibi. At the same time, a lost soul from a past case claims he has found his childhood abuser, hinting to Sigurdur that he&#x2019;s ended his preying on children. Black Skies continues the series&#x2019; exploration of Iceland&#x2019;s social ills, this time exploring how national prosperity has brought with it a different kind trickle-down effect: greed and malignant power working their way throughout society. --Christine Tran</p><h2>Preacher&#39;s Slaughter (Preacher/First Mountain Man)</h2><p><b>The Greatest Western Writer Of The 21st Century</b><br><br>On the rolling Missouri River a riverboat of fur traders, a U.S. Senator and Prussian royalty are all heading to the Yellowstone from St. Louis.

The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.<br><i>The Coldest Girl in Coldtown </i>is a wholly original story of rage and revenge, of guilt and horror, and of love and loathing from bestselling and acclaimed author Holly Black.</p><p>Holly Black is the bestselling author of contemporary fantasy books for kids and teens.

He has no inkling that his destiny is far greater than the small planet he has inhabited for the first twenty-odd years of his life. One frosty winter night in the New England woods, he finds himself transported to the planet of Gor, also known as Counter-Earth, where everything is dramatically different from anything he has ever experienced. It emerges that Tarl is to be trained as a Tarnsman, one of the most honored positions in the rigid, caste-bound Gorean society. He is disciplined by the best teachers and warriors that Gor has to offer...but to what end? This is the first installment of John Norman&#39;s wildly popular and controversial Gor series, which has sold millions of copies. Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the first book of the Gorean Saga, TARNSMAN OF GOR, E-Reads is proud to release the very first complete publication of all Gor books by John Norman, in both print and ebook editions, including the long-awaited 26th novel in the saga, WITNESS OF GOR. Many of the original Gor books have been out of print for years, but their popularity has endured. Each book of this release has been specially edited by the author and is a definitive text.</p><p>John Norman, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, is the creator of the Gorean Saga, the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. Starting in&nbsp;December 1966 with&nbsp;<i>Tarnsman of Gor</i>, the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment,&nbsp;<i>Magicians of Gor</i>, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor,&nbsp;<i>Witness of Gor</i>. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series, the Telnarian Histories, plus two other fiction works (<i>Ghost Dance</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Time Slave</i>), a nonfiction paperback (<i>Imaginative Sex</i>), and a collection of thirty short stories, entitled&nbsp;<i>Norman Invasions</i>.&nbsp;<i>The Totems of Abydos&nbsp;</i>was published in spring 2012.&nbsp;<br><br> All of Norman&#x2019;s work is available both in print and as ebooks.

Willis, a curator of photography at the Smithsonian Institution, has selected nearly 600 stunning images that give us rich, hugely moving glimpses of black life, from slavery to the Great Migrations, from rare antebellum portraits to 1990s middle-class families. Featuring the work of undisputed masters such as James Presley Ball, C. M. Battey, James VanDerZee, Morgan and Marvin Smith, Gordon Parks, Moneta Sleet, Jr., and Carrie Mae Weems, among hundreds of others, Reflections in Black is, most powerfully, a refutation of the gross caricature of the many mainstream photographers who have continually emphasized poverty over family, despair over hope. Recalling Roman Vishniac's <em>Vanished World</em> in terms of its documentary importance, and Brian Lanker's <em>I Dream a World</em> in terms of its exceptional beauty, <em>Reflections in Black</em> is not only an exceptional gift book for any occasion but also a work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure our conception of American history itself. It demands to be included in every American family's library as the record of an essential part of our heritage. Publication will coincide and tie in with a major exhibition at The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, which will then travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Albany, New York; Corpus Christi, Texas; and other cities.</p><p>A triumphant celebration of family, endurance, spirituality, and the diverse range of the black experience over the last two centuries, Reflections in Black overturns many common ideas about black life during the last century and a half, and through its sheer power and beauty rewrites American history itself.<p>Reflections in Black, the first comprehensive history of black photographers, is Deborah Willis's long-awaited, groundbreaking assemblage of photographs of African American life from 1840 to the present. Willis, a curator of photography at the Smithsonian Institution, has selected nearly 600 stunning photographs, with 487 in duotone and 81 in full color, of which more than 100 images have never before been seen. As this panoramic saga unfolds, we are given rich, hugely moving glimpses of African American life, from the last generation of slaves to the urban pioneers of the great migrations of the 1920s, from rare antebellum daguerreotypes of freemen to the courtly celebrants of the Harlem Renaissance, from civil rights martyrs to postmodern photographic artists of the 1990s.</p><p>Each photograph suggests an astonishing, often spellbinding story. Augustus Washington's mid-nineteenth-century portraits of African Americans, for example, offer a window of seeming calm in an American era known largely for its upheaval. A startling suite of J. P. Ball photographs depicts, in three images, the life, death, and burial of a black man hanged for murder in the territory of Montana. Equally arresting are the twentieth-century images: from James VanDerZee's glittering shot of a Harlem couple decked out in raccoon coats, to Ellie Lee Weems's photographs of everyday African Americans in 1930sAtlanta, to Addison Scurlock's gorgeous wedding photos, to A. P. Bedou's portrait of a rapt crowd listening to Booker T. Washington, to John W. Mosely's image of a young drum majorette marching in an Elks parade in 1940s Philadelphia, to Clarissa Sligh's fascinating peeks at African Americans submitting to the deceptively mundane chores of haircuts. These images reinforce the notion that there is no single black America, but a multitude of diversity and richness.</p><p>Also in Reflections in Black are great celebrity images, including classic photographs of Frederick Douglass, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Dinah Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Sarah Vaughn, Malcolm X, Muhammed Ali, James Coltrane, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and a veiled Coretta Scott King at her husband's funeral.</p><p>Reflections in Black is, finally and most powerfully, a refutation of the gross caricature of so many photographers who have, in their depiction of African Americans, continually emphasized poverty over family, despair over hope, rage over accomplishment. Exceptionally beautiful, monumentally important, Reflections in Black is not only that rare gift book that can be given on any occasion but also a work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure the imagination. It demands to be included in every American family's library as an essential part of our country's heritage.</p>Deborah Willis, a MacArthur, Guggenheim, and Fletcher Fellow, is the author of Reflections in Black, Posing Beauty, Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs, and the New York Times bestseller Obama: The Historic Campaign in Photographs. She is chair of the photography department and a University Professor at New York University.</p><h2>Sleeping Beauties</h2><p>A father-son collaboration envisions a near-future where the women succumb to a sleeping disease, the men revert to their increasingly primal natures and one woman, mysteriously immune, struggles to survive in an Appalachian prison town where she is treated alternately as a demon and a lab specimen.

Ms. Ewing lives in Los Angeles, California, and Washington, DC.This sexy but lackluster fantasy novel kicks off the Daughters of the Moon series by the author of Drive-By and Party Girl. High school sophomore Vanessa and her best friend, Catty, have magical powers. But while Catty sees her ability to time travel as a gift, Vanessa hates her own ability to turn invisible: she "tried to control her molecules, but in times of intense emotion, her molecules had more power than her ability to restrain them and the light from a full moon seemed to fuel their charge." Vanessa wants to date the handsome, long-haired Michael and be like everyone else, but whenever he kisses her, her feet and hands start disappearing. Then Catty turns up missing, and Vanessa's new friend Serena (a mind reader) reveals that they are goddesses, Daughters of the Moon, who must battle the evil Atrox and its dissolute band of "Followers" (from whose souls Atrox has sucked all hope) who haunt the Los Angeles club scene. Multicultural and cutting-edge, the California-hip backdrop may appeal to some readers and the book contains enough affirmations of "girl power" to please any budding feminist. But in the end, this series reads like an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer without the camp. Into the Cold Fire, the next in the series, follows Serena as she falls prey to the dark side.

But business quickly mixes with Lois&#x2019;s nose for sleuthing when she&#x2019;s hired to clean the house of the pompous mayor, and then witnesses his honor&#x2019;s limo picking up a dubious-looking package from the mysterious shop. There&#x2019;s a filthy underside to Tresham, and when bloody murder starts staining the quaint town, Lois has to put her own life on the line to straighten things out...</p><p><b>Ann Purser&nbsp;</b>was born in Market Harborough in Leicestershire and has lived most of her life in villages. She has turned her hand to many things, including journalist (as a columnist for&nbsp;<i>SHE</i>&nbsp;magazine), keeper of hens and donkeys, art gallery owner, clerical assistant in a village school, Open University graduate, novelist, mother of three, wife of Philip Purser, critic, and writer. She is an avid reader of detective stories.Lois Meade, amateur sleuth and owner of New Brooms cleaning services, is back on the case. Well paced, cleverly plotted, and chock-full of cozy glimpses of life in a small English village, Purser's latest has Lois partnering again with local detective (and secret admirer) Hunter Cowgill. When Howard Jenkinson, the mayor of nearby Tresham, is found floating facedown in his backyard fishpond, his death appears to be a tragic accident. But things don't quite add up, and Detective Cowgill persuades Lois to do her usual discreet snooping. Despite the disapproval of her family, Lois uses her cadre of dedicated cleaners to help piece together bits of village gossip, odds and ends of past history, and snippets of information that eventually crack the case wide open. Even the usually unflappable Lois is shocked to learn that the civilized veneer of her peaceful village conceals a shocking tale of wife swapping, betrayal, and revenge. A fine series that just keeps getting better--a must for British cozy fans. <i>Emily Melton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is well aware that he must handle the highly sensitive&#x2014;and dangerously explosive&#x2014;investigation with the utmost discretion.</p><p>Because the case may involve police corruption, an officer from Professional Standards, Inspector Joanna Passero, has arrived to work with Banks and his team. Though he tries to keep an open mind and offer his full cooperation, the dedicated Banks and his practical investigative style clash with Passero's cool demeanor and by-the- book professionalism. All too soon, the seasoned detective finds himself under uncomfortable scrutiny, his methods second-guessed.</p><p>As Banks digs deeper into the life and career of the victim, a decorated cop and recent widower named Bill Quinn, he comes to believe that Quinn's murder may be linked to an unsolved missing persons case. Six years earlier, a pretty nineteen-year-old English girl named Rachel Hewitt made national headlines when she disappeared without a trace in Tallinn, Estonia. Convinced that finding the truth about Rachel will lead to Quinn's killer, Banks follows a twisting trail of clues that lead from England to the dark, cobbled alleys of Tallinn's Old Town. But the closer he seems to solving the complicated cold case, the more it becomes clear that someone doesn't want the past stirred up.</p><p>While Banks prowls the streets of Tallinn, DI Annie Cabbot, recovered from her near-fatal shooting and back at the station in Eastvale, is investigating a migrant labor scam involving corrupt bureaucrats and a loan shark who feeds on the poor. As evidence in each investigation mounts, Banks realizes the two are linked&#x2014;and that solving them may put even more lives, including his own, in jeopardy.</p></p><p><p>A decorated policeman is murdered on the tranquil grounds of the St. Peter&#x2019;s Police Treatment Center, shot through the heart with a crossbow arrow, and compromising photographs are discovered in his room.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is well aware that he must handle the highly sensitive and dangerously explosive investigation with the utmost discretion.

Tour.</p><p>Some great rock songs have lyrics that make an indelible impression, while others impress because of their melodies or instrumentation, and still others are memorable because of their overall atmospherics, their "feel." Such is the appeal of Wolfman Jack's autobiography--its feel. The Wolfman lovingly and proudly communicates the atmosphere of the rock 'n' roll world as he describes his career--he started on a superpowerful, unregulated AM radio station in Mexico; he then landed network TV gigs, stateside disc-jockey jobs, and movie appearances; finally, he has become a contemporary icon. Station XERF, just across the border from Del Rio, Texas, reached most of the U.S. West and Midwest with plenty of radio ministries and Wolfman Jack's wild, howling shows. Always an advocate of black music, the Wolfman mixed records by blues and rhythm-and-blues artists with more mainstream rock to pioneer the parents-of-teens' aural nightmare that is now so familiar from its portrayal in numerous don't-knock-the-rock movies. The Wolfman then parlayed notoriety into fame and fame into fortune. It's a story he tells in a swashbuckling style that recalls his days in pirate radio, and although he names the names and fixes the places, it's not a rock reference but a highly entertaining peer to the finest recent rock autobiographies. <i>Mike Tribby</i>Host of America's first syndicated rock-and-roll radio program and the inspiration for George Lucas's American Graffiti, Bob Smith, aka Wolfman Jack, is one of radio's legendary figures, and this autobiography reveals that his life has been as colorful as his broadcasts. Wolfman recounts his childhood passion for the black music ignored by mainstream radio in the 1950s, his lowly beginnings as an ad rep for a small station in Norfolk, Va., and the wild story of his career as a radio DJ near the Mexican border?a career initiated by a wild west-style shootout with one station's owners. Writing with Laursen (Show Time), Wolfman dishes out his take on the politics of the music industry, the many music-biz celebrities he's known and what it's like to live a rock-and-roll lifestyle. His fast-paced story is peppered with generous tributes to the musicians?Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley and a slew of others?who "supplied the original heart of rock 'n' roll." Rock music fans will find inspiration in these memoirs of a man whose finger has been on the pulse of American rock for decades. Photos.

The essays are reprinted from Hardie's newspaper and magazine columns, 1966 through 1987, about life with her husband and four children on a farm outside of Baltimore. (There was a hiatus: after the death of her oldest son in 1975, Hardie stopped writing for five years.) Topics range from the first entry when Hardie turns 40 and consoles herself with fringe benefits: "Let the younger mothers decorate the school fair." During the following decades, Hardie entertains us with adventures, such as slipping away to a reunion with a college chum in a pricey New York restaurant: "It makes you feel better, absolutely First Class." Still the best times are back in the 150-year-old house and grounds, fighting weeds, coping with recalcitrant teenagers and the bliss, at last, of becoming a grandmother. The book includes tempting recipes from Hardie Farm and is altogether charming except for one small slip: Contrary to Hardie's reference to miserly millionaire Hetty Green as childless, Green had a son who was a victim of her greed. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kneeling in Bethlehem</h2><p>Poems deal with Advent, the Christmas spirit, Bethlehem the birth of Jesus, Christmases of the past, and faith</p><p><b>Ann Weems</b> is a Presbyterian elder, a lecturer, and a popular poet.

Naps usually filled him with a nameless dread. Every time he put his head on a pillow, he would remember something he needed to do--something to clean (though he wasn't really that clean) or a book he'd been meaning to read. Or he'd develop a sudden fear of embarrassing himself: mumbling an old boyfriend's name, say, or drooling or some other act still undreamed of, outside civilization's parameters. But nothing, finally, explained how unacceptable it was to be lying there--in daylight--lying there while the rest of the world was awake. How did people do it?</p><p>On the day in question, though, a Sunday in March, Patrick had been trailing clouds of sleep deprivation. All week long he'd been sleeping poorly, and the night before, three teenage boys had broken into his car, which was parked behind his Victorian row house on Capitol Hill. Patrick might have slept till morning unawares except a neighbor on the other side of the back alley saw the crime in progress and yelled at the boys until they ran away. Then he knocked on Patrick's door to explain what had happened, and just as Patrick was about to thank him and go back to bed, the neighbor mentioned that the police had been called and were on their way. Patrick called twice over the next hour, asking the police not to come. Two hours later a patrolman knocked on the door. He and Patrick waited another half hour for the fingerprint specialist. Still wearing his bathrobe, Patrick led them through the backyard to the car. The first thing he noticed was the Oldsmobile's steering column, which had been peeled open like a can. The second thing was the glass from the rear left passenger window, which had resolved itself into smooth, glittering candy pebbles on the gravel.</p><p>He fell asleep around 5. Around 6, his downstairs tenant, Deanna, woke him up to tell him about his car: She'd seen it during her morning jog. This left him only a few minutes of sleep before he had to get up for his violin lesson. His teacher--a radiant freckled woman named Sonya, with a river of auburn hair--lived only three blocks away, but 7:30 on Sunday morning was the only time of the week they could get together. Patrick was not improving.</p></p><p>Bayard's accomplished debut novel, a witty romantic comedy, is set in Washington, D.C.'s gay community, a group, says one character, that is smaller than Mayberry. Despite very few degrees of separation, 32-year-old Patrick Beaton is having trouble locating his ideal man, a figure of perfection he met (or dreamed he met) briefly at a Sunday brunch. Patrick is aided in his search for the man he calls "Scottie" by Seth, a persistent, perspiring sidekick who has his own reasons for wanting Patrick to get over this obsession. Numerous subplots, including side romances, rat infestations and a visit from Patrick's non-Irish but brogue-spouting father, revolve around and involve Patrick's quest for Scottie, but Bayard, like Armistead Maupin in his Tales of the City series, is a master of tightly woven, oddly believable coincidence-driven plotting. Like Maupin, and Stephen McCauley, Bayard's snappy dialogue manages to be more funny than people really are, and utterly convincing at the same time. He excels at gently skewering aspects of urban gay culture: a young man in a tank top with "his car keys [dangling] from his nipple ring"; a group of dancers in a western theme bar, "cantering in a circle like high-bred fillies." Readers are never sure what twists or turns are coming, but Bayard makes Patrick's poignant, fumbling attempts to achieve domestic bliss a journey gay (and gay-friendly) readers will be eager to embark upon, and travel along to the satisfying end.

Two years after her birth, the family moved to Oslo, where her father, a distinguished archaeologist, taught at the university. Her father's interest in the past had a tremendous influence on Undset. She was particularly entranced by the dramatic Old Norse sagas she read as a child, later declaring that her exposure to them marked "the most important turning point in my life."<p>Undset's first published works&#x2014;the novel <b>Mrs. Marta Oulie </b>(1907) and a short-story collection <b>The Happy Age</b> (1908)&#x2014;were set in contemporary times and achieved both critical and popular success. With her reputation as a writer well-established, Undset had the freedom to explore the world that had first fired her imagination, and in <b>Gunnar's Daughter</b> (1909) she drew upon her knowledge of Norway's history and legends, including the Icelandic Sagas, to recreate medieval life with compelling immediacy. In 1912 Undset married the painter Anders Castus Svarstad and over the next ten years faced the formidable challenge of raising three stepchildren and her own three off-spring with little financial or emotional support from her husband. Eventually, she and her children moved from Oslo to Lillehammer, and her marriage was annulled in 1924, when Undset converted to Catholicism.</p><p>Although Undset wrote more modern novels, a collection of essays on feminism, as well as numerous book reviews and newspaper articles, her fascination with the Middle Ages never ebbed, and in 1920 she published <b>The Wreath</b>, the first volume of her most famous work, <b>Kristin Lavransdatter</b>. The next two volumes quickly followed&#x2014;<b>The Wife</b> in 1921, and <b>The Cross</b> in 1922. The trilogy earned Undset worldwide acclaim, and her second great medieval epic&#x2014;the four-volume <b>The Master of Hestviken</b> (1925-1927) &#x2014;confirmed her place as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. In 1928, at the age of 46, she received the Nobel Prize for Literature, only the third woman to be so honored.</p><p>Undset went on to publish more novels&#x2014;including the autobiographical <b>The Longest Years</b>&#x2014;and several collections of essays during the 1930s. As the Germans advanced through Norway in 1940, Undset, an outspoken critic of Nazism, fled the country and eventually settled in Brooklyn, New York. She returned to her homeland in 1945, and two years later she was awarded Norway's highest honor for her "distinguished literary work and for service to her country." The years of exile, however, had taken a great toll on her, and she died of a stroke on June 10, 1949.</p><p>Brad Leithauser is the author of several novels, four volumes of poetry, and a collection of essays.

She and her family live in New York.<p>Introduction by Pamela Paul</p> <p>We all want to know what other people are reading. We peer at strangers&#x2019; book covers on an airplane and lean over their e-books on the subway. We squint at the iPhone of the person standing in front of us in the elevator. We scan bestseller lists and customer reviews and online social reading sites. Asking someone what she&#x2019;s read lately is an easy conversational gambit&#x2014;and the answer is almost bound to be more interesting than the weather. It also serves an actual purpose: we may find out about something <i>we</i> want to read ourselves.</p> <p>When I launched By the Book in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, it was an effort to satisfy my own genuine, insatiable desire to know what others&#x2014;smart people, well-read people, people who are good writers themselves&#x2014;were reading in their spare time. The idea was to stimulate a conversation over books, but one that took place at a more exalted level than the average watercooler chat. That meant starting big, and for me that meant David Sedaris. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to know which books he thinks are funny? Or touching or sad or just plain good?</p> <p>In coming up with the questions for David Sedaris, and then for those who followed, I decided to keep some consistent&#x2014;What book would you recommend to the president to read?&#x2014;while others would come and go. If you&#x2019;re going to find out what books John Grisham likes, you&#x2019;ve got to ask about legal thrillers. When talking to P. J. O&#x2019;Rourke, you want to know about satire.</p> <p>Similarly, the range of writers for By the Book had to sweep wide, to include relative unknowns and new voices alongside the James Pattersons and Mary Higgins Clarks. That meant poets and short story writers and authors of mass market fiction. And while the most obvious, and often most desirable, participants would be authors themselves, I didn&#x2019;t want to limit the conversation to book people.</p> <p>For that reason, I went to Lena Dunham (not an author at the time) next. I asked musicians like Pete Townshend and Sting, scientists and actors, the president of Harvard, and even an astrophysicist. Cross-pollination between the arts&#x2014;and the sciences&#x2014;is something many of us haven&#x2019;t experienced since our college days, and I wanted to evoke some of that excitement of unexpected discovery&#x2014;in the subjects, in the questions, and in the answers.</p> <p>Once the ball got rolling, an unexpected discovery on my part was the full-throttle admiration our most respected public figures have for one another. Colin Powell marveled over J. K. Rowling&#x2019;s ability to endure the spotlight. Michael Chabon, Jeffrey Eugenides, and Donna Tartt were all consumed by the Patrick Melrose novels of Edward St. Aubyn. (He, in turn, was reading Alice Munro.) Writer after writer extolled the reportorial prowess of Katherine Boo. And then Boo, who told me she read the column religiously, praised Junot D�az and George Saunders and Cheryl Strayed when it was her turn.</p> <p>When I&#x2019;d meet writers at book parties or literary lunches, they&#x2019;d thrill over what other By the Book subjects had said about their work. In her interview, Donna Tartt told me how much she looked forward to reading Stephen King&#x2019;s new novel&#x2014;before he&#x2019;d raved about <i>The Goldfinch</i> on our cover. In a world that can feel beset by cynicism, envy, and negative reviews, By the Book has become a place for accomplished peers to express appreciation for one another&#x2019;s art.</p> <p>Then there are the humanizing foibles. The books we never finished or are embarrassed never to have picked up, the books we hated, the books we threw across the room. It&#x2019;s not just us. Many writers confess here to unorthodox indulgences (Hilary Mantel adores self-help books) and &#x201c;failures&#x201d; of personal taste (neither Richard Ford nor Ian McEwan has much patience for <i>Ulysses</i>).</p> <p>Reading the interviews gathered together for the first time, I found myself flipping back and forth between pages, following one author to another, from one writer&#x2019;s recommendation to another&#x2019;s explication of plot, like browsing an endlessly varied, annotated home library in the company of thoughtful and erudite friends. I learned about mutual loves, disagreements, surprise recommendations, unexpected new voices, forgotten classics. Let the conversation begin.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by Pamela Paul</p></p><h2>Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Four Kings</h2><p><p> The story of that amazingly influential and still somewhat mysterious woman, <i>Eleanor of Aquitaine</i>, has the dramatic interest of a novel. She was at the very center of the rich culture and clashing politics of the twelfth century. Richest marriage prize of the Middle Ages, she was Queen of France as the wife of Louis VII, and went with him on the exciting and disastrous Second Crusade. Inspiration of troubadours and trouv�res, she played a large part in rendering fashionable the Courts of Love and in establishing the whole courtly tradition of medieval times. Divorced from Louis, she married Henry Plantagenet, who became Henry II of England. Her resources and resourcefulness helped Henry win his throne, she was involved in the conflict over Thomas Becket, and, after Henry's death, she handled the affairs of the Angevin empire with a sagacity that brought her the trust and confidence of popes and kings and emperors. </p><p> Having been first a Capet and then a Plantagenet, Queen Eleanor was the central figure in the bitter rivalry between those houses for the control of their continental domains--a rivalry that excited the whole period: after Henry's death, her sons, Richard Coeur-de-Lion and John "Lackland" (of Magna Charta fame), fiercely pursued the feud up to and even beyond the end of the century. But the dynastic struggle of the period was accompanied by other stirrings: the intellectual revolt, the struggle between church and state, the secularization of literature and other arts, the rise of the distinctive urban culture of the great cities. Eleanor was concerned with all the movements, closely connected with all the personages; and she knew every city from London and Paris to Byzantium, Jerusalem, and Rome. Miss Kelly's story of the queen's long life--the first modern biography brings together more authentic information about her than has ever been assembled before and reveals in Eleanor a greatness of vision, an intelligence, and a political sagacity that have been missed by those who have dwelt on her caprice and frivolity. It also brings to life the whole period in whose every aspect Eleanor and her four kings were so intimately and influentially involved. Miss Kelly tells Eleanor's absorbing story as it has long waited to be told--with verve and style and a sense of the quality of life in those times, and yet with a scrupulous care for the historic facts. </p></p><p>Was there ever a ruler, man or woman, quite as fascinating as Eleanor of Aquitaine? The ruler of France&#39;s largest kingdom from the age of 15, Eleanor (1122- 1204) was renowned for beauty, intelligence, and the thoughtful application of power. Her marriage to her second husband, Henry Plantagenet of Normandy, brought her to the English throne; the birth of their sons John Lackland and Richard I Lionheart forever changed the face of medieval European history. Always at the center of her world, Eleanor remains a fascinating figure even today, and Amy Kelly captures the whirlwind of her life in this entrancing biography.This account of Queen Eleanor and her century is offered as a study of individuals who set their stamp upon the events of their time, rather than as a study of developing systems of politics, economics, or jurisprudence.</p><h2>Joanna (Sunfire)</h2><p>A young woman tries to find love and happiness as she struggles to survive the harsh working conditions in a textile mill</p><p></p><h2>The Procrastination Workbook: Your Personalized Program for Breaking Free from the Patterns That Hold You Back</h2><p><p>Procrastination is a near-universal trait, at its most troublesome when it holds someone back from doing well in school, adds a frustrating dimension to personal relationships, or closes off the road to professional fulfillment with an endless series of detours and roadblocks.</p><p>Based on over thirty years of clinical experience and research, this workbook distills the essence of the best insights and the most effective techniques to help you identify the root causes of your procrastination problem and find workable solutions for overcoming it.

A classic.<br> Ursula Goodenough<br> Author of <i>The Sacred Depths of Nature</i><br> <br> Piercing, funny, brilliant, transcendent, angry, eloquent.

In an age of militant atheists and strident believers, Chet Raymo dares to stand, where mystics and philosophers have always stood, in the place of mystery. <br> Douglas Burton-Christie, PhD<br> Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles<br> <br> Raymo reminds us that human consciousness is plenty big enough to accommodate both science and a sense of the holy. <br> Nancy Mairs<br> Author of <i>A Dynamic God</i><br>Chet Raymo is Professor Emeritus at Stonehill College in North Easton, Massachusetts.

In his new book he zeros in on what motivates men and provides tips on how women can use that knowledge to get more of what they need out of their relationships, whether it's more help around the house, more of the right kind of attention in the bedroom, more money in the joint bank account, or more truth when it comes to the hard questions, such as: Are you committed to building a future together?

Steve shows you how to talk to your man in a way that moves him to action and keeps the peace.</p> <p>And there's much more, including Steve's candid answers to questions you've always wanted to ask men.</p> <p>Drawing on a lifetime of experience and the feedback women have shared with him in reaction to <em>Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man</em>, Harvey offers wisdom on a wealth of topics relevant to both sexes today. He also gets more personal, sharing anecdotes from his own family history. Always direct, often funny, and incredibly perceptive, media personality, comedian, philanthropist, and (finally) happily married husband, Steve Harvey proves once again that he is the king of relationships.</p></p><p><p>The author of <em>Act Like a Success, Think Like a Success</em>; <em>Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man</em>; and <em>Straight Talk, No Chaser</em>, Steve Harvey began doing stand-up comedy in the mid-1980s.

Jonathan Darrow is an Anglican priest when he receives a shattering vision and knows he must leave the monastery that has been his home for seventeen years. As he plunges into the temptations of the real world, a crisis sends him into the labyrinth of his past to pluck out the buried truth beneath the deceptions he has been living through.</p><p><b>Susan Howatch</b> was born in Surrey. After getting a degree in law, she emigrated to America, where she married, had a daughter, and embarked on a career as a writer. When she eventually left the United States, she lived in the Republic of Ireland for four years before returning to England. She spent time in Salisbury&#x2014;which was the inspiration for her Starbridge sequence of novels&#x2014;and now lives in London.1<br> &nbsp;<br> THE VISION BEGAN AT A QUARTER TO SIX; AROUND ME THE ROOM was suffused with light, not the pellucid light of a fine midsummer morning but the dim light of a wet dawn in May. I was sitting on the edge of my bed when without warning the gold lettering on the cover of the Bible began to glow.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stood up as the bedside table deepened in hue, and the next moment the floorboards pulsed with light while in the corner the taps of the basin coruscated like silver in the sun. Backing around the edge of the bed I pressed my back against the wall before any further alteration of consciousness occurred. Firm contact with a solid object lessens the instinctive fear which must always accompany such a radical transcendence of time and space.<br> &nbsp;<br> However after the initial fear comes the equally instinctive acceptance. I had closed my eyes to lessen the terror of disorientation but now I forced myself to open them. The cell was still glittering, but as I watched the glitter faded to a shimmer until the scene resembled a view seen through the wrong end of a telescope, and I could perceive my body, remote and abandoned, pressed against the wall by the bed as if impaled there by invisible nails. I looked aside&#x2014;I could see my body turning its head&#x2014;and immediately the darkness, moving from right to left, began to erase the telescopic view. My eyes closed, again warding off the fear of disorientation, and this time when I reopened them I found I was once more moving in a normal world.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was myself, inhabiting my body as usual and walking along a path through a wood of beech trees. Insofar as I was conscious of any emotion I was aware of being at ease with my verdant, tranquil surroundings, although I felt irritated by the persistent call of a wood-pigeon. Eventually the pigeon fell silent and as the path began to slope downhill, I glanced to my left at the chapel in the dell below.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chapel was small but exquisite in its classical symmetry; I was reminded of the work of Inigo Jones. In the dull green light of the surrounding woods the yellow stone glowed a dark gold, a voluptuous contrast to the grey medieval ruins which lay behind it. The ruins were in part hidden by ivy, but as I moved closer I could see the slits in the wall of the tower.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reaching the floor of the dell I faced the chapel, now only fifty yards away across the sward, and it was then that I noticed the suitcase. Standing at the edge of the trees it was sprinkled with labels, the largest being a triangle of red, blue and black design; I was too far away to read the lettering. Afterwards I remembered that I had regarded this suitcase without either curiosity or surprise. Certainly I never slackened my pace as I headed for the chapel, and I believe I knew even then that the suitcase was a mere image on the retina of my mind, a symbol which at that point I had no interest in interpreting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hurrying up the steps of the porch I lifted the latch, pushed the right-hand half of the double-doors wide open and paused to survey the interior beyond.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no transept. A central aisle stretched to the altar at the east end. The altar-table was stark in its austerity, the only adornment consisting of a plain wooden cross, but again I felt neither surprise nor curiosity. Evidently I was as accustomed to this sight as I was accustomed to the fact that the nave was only three-quarters full of pews. Walking across the empty space which separated the doors from the back pew, I could smell the lilies which were blooming in a vase beneath the brass memorial plaque on my right. I gave them no more than a brief glance but when I looked back at the altar I saw that the light had changed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sun was penetrating the window which was set high in the wall to the left of the altar, and as the ray began to slant densely upon the cross I stopped dead. Unless I stood south of the Equator I was witnessing the impossible, for the sun could never shine from the north. I stared at the light until my eyes began to burn. Then sinking to my knees I covered my face with my hands, and as the vision at last dissolved, the knowledge was branded upon my mind that I had to abandon the work which suited me so well and begin my life anew in the world I had no wish to rejoin.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> OPENING MY EYES I FOUND MYSELF BACK IN MY CELL. I WAS NO longer pressing against the wall but kneeling by the bed. Sweat prickled my forehead. My hands were trembling. There were also other physical manifestations which I prefer not to describe. Indeed I felt quite unfit to begin my daily work but so profound was my state of shock that I automatically embarked on my morning routine, and minutes later I was leaving my cell.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps I have erred in starting this narrative with an account of my vision. Perhaps I should instead have offered some essential biographical details, for the repeated mention of the word &#x201c;cell&#x201d; has almost certainly conveyed the impression that I am an inmate of one of His Majesty&#x2019;s prisons. Let me now correct this mistake. For the past seventeen years I have been a member of the Anglican brotherhood of monks known as the Fordite Order of St. Benedict and St. Bernard. I may still be judged eccentric, anti-social and possibly (after this account of my vision) deranged. But I am not a criminal.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order that such an abnormal experience can be put in its proper context and judged fairly, I must attempt a thumbnail sketch of my past so let me state at once that in many ways my life has been exceedingly normal. I was brought up in a quiet, respectable home, educated at various appropriate establishments and ordained as a clergyman of the Church of England not long after my twenty-third birthday. I then married a young woman who possessed what in my young day was described as &#x201c;allure&#x201d; and which a later generation, debased by the War&#x2014;the First War, as I suppose we must now call it&#x2014;described as &#x201c;It.&#x201d; For some years after my marriage I worked as a chaplain to the Naval base at Starmouth, and later I volunteered for duty at sea with the result that much of my ministry was spent away from home. In fact I was absent when my wife died in 1912. For another seven years I continued my career in the Navy, but I judge it unnecessary to recount my war experiences. Suffice it to say that after the Battle of Jutland I never felt quite the same about the sea again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Accordingly in 1919 I left the Navy and became the chaplain at Starmouth Prison. The advantage of this change was that I was able to see more of my children, now adolescent, but the disadvantage was that I became aligned with an authority empowered to administer capital and corporal punishment, two practices which are entirely contrary to my conception of the Christian way to treat human beings. However I endured this harrowing ministry as best as I could until finally in 1923 the hour of my liberation dawned: with both my children launched on their adult lives I was able to retire to the Cambridgeshire village of Grantchester, where the Fordites had a house, and embark on my career as a monk. I had known the Abbot, James Reid, since my undergraduate days at the University two miles away, and although I had lost touch with him some years earlier it never occurred to me not to seek his help when I was at last free to join the Order.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shall gloss over the disastrous beginning of my new life and simply state that after three months at Grantchester I was transferred to the Fordites&#x2019; farm at Ruydale, a remote corner of the North Yorkshire moors where the monks lived more in the austere style of Cistercians than Benedictines. Here I embarked on a successful cenobitic career which reached its apex in 1937 when I was transferred back to Grantchester to succeed James Reid as Abbot.<br> &nbsp;<br> This brief autobiographical recital&#x2014;remarkable more for what I have omitted than for what I have deigned to reveal&#x2014;is all I intend to disclose at present about my past. No further disclosures are needed, I think, to show that my ministry has always demanded a strong constitution, absolute sanity and considerable reserves of spiritual strength. In short, although I write as a monk who has visions, I am neither a hysteric nor a schizophrenic. I am a normal man with abnormal aspects&#x2014;and having abnormal aspects, as Abbot James had assured me when I was a troubled young ordinand, was what being normal was all about.<br> &nbsp;<br> But beware of those glamorous powers, Jon!&#x201d; he had urged after we had discussed my gifts as a psychic. &#x201c;Beware of those powers which come from God but which can so easily be purloined by the Devil!&#x201d; This had proved a prophetic warning. For the next twenty years, while I remained in the world, my life was one long struggle to achieve the correct balance between the psychic and the spiritual so that I could develop properly as a priest, but it was a struggle I failed to win. There was little development. I did become a competent priest in the limited sense that the world judged my ministry to be effective, but my spiritual progress suffered from inadequate guidance and an undisciplined psyche. As Father Darcy told me later, I was like a brilliant child who had learnt the alphabet but had never been trained to read and write. However this situation changed when I became a monk, and it changed because for the first time I found the man who had the spiritual range and the sheer brute force of personality required to train me.</p><h2>Teaching for Spiritual Growth</h2><p><p>Teaching for Spiritual Growth deals with two important questions: 1) What does it mean to be spiritually mature ? and 2) What can the church do to help people grow spiritually? These questions are explored from the perspectives of theology, developmental psychology, and educational learning theory. The book integrates the three perspectives into a unified view of the teaching-learning process based on a biblical view of persons: 1. Theology: the divine side of spiritual growth. What does the nature of God tell us about teaching spiritual maturity? 2. Psychology: how God has designed people to grow. How does human development affect the process of achieving spiritual maturity? 3. Education: the learning process that produces spiritual growth. What is the process people go through to achieve spiritual maturity? The goal is to help readers develop a philosophy of Christian education that will be applicable to a variety of ministry contexts.</p></p><p>Perry G.

He shares his view that EIT, when applied correctly, were useful in drawing detainees to cooperate, and that, when applied incorrectly, they were counter-productive. &nbsp;He also chronicles what it is like to undertake a several-years-long critical mission at the request of the government only to be hounded for nearly a decade afterward by congressional investigations and Justice Department prosecutors.<br><br>Gripping in its detail and deeply illuminating, <i>Enhanced Interrogation</i> argues that it is necessary for America to take strong measures to defend itself from its enemies and that the country is less safe now without them than it was before 9/11.</p><p><b>DR.

The gentle, affecting first volume introduces elderly Mr. Putter, who decides that a cat will keep him from feeling lonely. Only kittens are available at the pet store (" 'Oh, no one wants cats, sir,' said the pet store lady. 'They are not cute. They are not peppy.' Mr. Putter himself has not been cute and peppy for a very long time"). At the animal shelter, however, he finds Tabby, a decidedly old yellow-and-white cat who needs a friend, too. In the second installment, quicker paced if less true to life, Mr. Putter and Tabby offer to take care of a neighbor's bulldog, Zeke, only to discover that Zeke isn't the darling "little lollypup" his owner believes him to be.

First published in 1964 to great acclaim, this book by one of the century&#39;s greatest explorers describes a way of life which lasted for thousands of years, but has now all but vanished. Travelling with his medicine boxes and his teams of canoemen around the junction between the Tigris and the Euphrates, Thesiger visited nearly every village in the Central Marshes and came to know intimately the people who inhabit this landscape of islands, lakes and waterways, living with them in their reed houses and sharing their unique way of life. He beautifully evokes the landscape and its teeming wildlife and vividly brings to life the many friends he made among the Marsh Arabs. His extraordinary photographs provide a stunning record of the last remnants of a people and their culture.</p><p>Wilfred Thesiger was born in 1910 in Ethiopia. From 1930 he travelled through remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. His journeys and his books have won him numerous prestigious awards over the years.

Gay points out that many of the discoveries were not made in Greece itself, but by Greeks throughout the Mediterranean basin. Each chapter concentrates on a different aspect of science, such as discoveries in geography, mathematics, astronomy, anatomy, etc. Because there is overlap in some of these fields, the text is occasionally confusing. However, it is helpful to have so much information on Greek scientific thought in one source. This should prove to be an effective source for reports. The index is very good, but the glossary is not useful because the definitions are too short and too vague. Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Pub .

(A 26 Fairmount Avenue Book)</h2><p>World War II is raging in Europe, and young Tomie finds that everyday life has changed in many ways. Sure, there&#x2019;s still New Year&#x2019;s Eve to celebrate, and he still has to face penmanship and arithmetic in second grade&#x2014; definitely not his strongest subjects. But now he has to wear an extra sweater to school because they&#x2019;re trying to conserve coal for heating. And a shopping trip to Hartford for Easter outfits seems more urgent in the face of looming shortages.<p> Just as he did in <i>I&#x2019;m Still Scared,</i> the first installment of <i>The War Years,</i> beloved author Tomie dePaola touchingly illuminates the emotional confusion of a child&#x2019;s life during wartime. <i>Why?</i> is another strong addition to the award-winning 26 Fairmount Avenue series.<br><br></p></p><p>Tomie dePaola is the artist and author/artist of more than two hundred books for young readers. He lives in New London, New Hampshire.Grade 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;This seventh installment in dePaola's autobiography covers New Year's Day through April 20, 1942. The war creates a backdrop that seems at first more interesting than ominous. Tomie overhears talk of rationing and hoarding, peeks out from behind blackout curtains, and notes that, due to the war, Fleer bubblegum will no longer be available. As ever, the author fills the story with authentically childlike details: he wishes that second-grade penmanship were easier, regrets that he can't make the Valentine mailbox in school, and visits a meatpacking warehouse. In the final chapter, news arrives that his cousin, Blackie, has died in the war. The book ends on a stark note&#x2014;an illustration of the second grader from behind, looking through a doorway, simply asking, "Why?" As in his previous autobiographical books, dePaola's spot-on sense of what children find interesting hits the bull's eye. He doesn't turn away from the profound sorrow of Blackie's death, setting it in the context of a loving extended family. The black-and-white full-page and spot pictures convey emotions effectively, and illustrate items that might be unfamiliar to 21st-century children. Facsimiles of diary pages enhance the story. Those who have enjoyed previous installments in the series, and those looking for a child's view of the Second World War, will want to read this.&#x2014;<i>Pat Leach, Lincoln City Libraries, NE</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This insightful story offers a child's-eye view of this seminal event in the American Civil Rights Movement. Connie is used to the signs and customs that have let her drink only from certain water fountains and which bar her from local pools and some stores, but still . . . she'd love to sit at the lunch counter, just like she's seen other girls do. <br> Showing how an ordinary family becomes involved in the great and personal cause of their times, it's a tale that invites everyone to celebrate our country's everyday heroes, of all ages.</p><p>Carole Boston Weatherford lives in High Point, North Carolina.Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2013;Connie likes to shop downtown with her mother. When they feel tired and hot, they stop in at Woolworth's for a cool drink, but stand as they sip their sodas since African Americans aren't allowed to sit at the lunch counter. Weatherford tells the story from the girl's point of view and clearly captures a child's perspective. Connie wants to sit down and have a banana split, but she can't, and she grumbles that, "All over town, signs told Mama and me where we could and couldn't go." When her father says that Dr. King is coming to town, she asks, "Who's sick?" She watches as her brother and sister join the NAACP and participate in the Greensboro, NC, lunch counter sit-ins. Eventually, Connie and her siblings get to sit down at the counter and have that banana split. Lagarrigue's impressionistic paintings convey a sense of history as they depict the pervasive signs of a Jim Crow society. An author's note about the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins concludes the book, pointing out the role young African Americans played in the struggle for civil rights. This book will pair well with Angela Johnson's <i>A Sweet Smell of Roses</i> (S &amp; S, 2005).<i>&#x2013;Mary N.

There are a lot of books about Warren Buffett, but A Few Lessons for Investors and Managers is different. It tells in a short-easy-to-read way about what managers and investors can learn from Buffett. This is a selection of useful and timeless wisdom where Warren Buffett in his own words tells us how to think about business valuation, what is a good and bad business, acquisitions and their traps, yardsticks, compensation issues, how to reduce risk, corporate governance, the importance of trust and the right culture, learning from mistakes, and more.</p><p></p><h2>The First Total War: Napoleon&#39;s Europe And the Birth of Warfare As We Know It</h2><p>A distinguished historian describes how the Enlightenment and the French Revolution led to the first total war in history during the age of Napoleon, when such embodiments of modern-day warfare--conscription, guerrilla warfare, unconditional surrender, disregard for the rules of combat, civilian mobilization, and more--made their first appearance.</p><p>David A. Bell is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Johns Hopkins and a contributing editor for the New Republic. A graduate of Harvard College, he completed his Ph.D. at Princeton and taught for several years at Yale. Bell has written for the New York Times, Slate, and Time, and was featured on the History Channel&#x2019;s program on the French Revolution.Bell combines his roles as professor of history at Johns Hopkins and contributing editor for the <i>New Republic</i> in this interpretive study arguing that history's first total war was waged during the Napoleonic era. Scholars have increasingly stressed the global aspects of the network of conflicts extending across North America, South Asia and Europe during that time. Bell goes further, presenting a fundamental transformation of war from an ordinary aspect of human existence to an apocalyptic experience whose "terrible sublimity" tested societies and individuals to their limits and ultimately became a redemptive experience. Total war developed not in the context of nationalism or revolutionary zeal, but in the fundamental sense of a "culture of war" driving participants in the direction of complete engagement and total abandonment of restraint. Ironically, the intellectual roots of this modern militarism are in the Enlightenment belief in the coming of perpetual peace. Revolutionary France transformed a moral concept into a practical one: war to emancipate humanity from its past. Bell's conclusion that this mentality survived two world wars is open to challenge, yet his appeal for the rediscovery of restraint and limitation is particularly relevant at a time of nuclear proliferation and apocalyptic rhetoric. <i>(Jan. 12)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Patience knew she couldn&#39;t be more different from the sort of women Dutch surgeon Julius van der Beek seemed to attract. After all, she was a quiet country girl with a somewhat unique taste in clothes - and an assertive personality to match! Yet she was attracted to him. Not that she had a hope of making him notice her, particularly with the glamorous Sylvia van Teule already at his side...</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#39;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The two men stood at the window, contemplating the dreary January afternoon outside, and then by common consent turned to look at the room in which they were.<p>'Of course,' observed the elder of the two, a short, stout man with a thatch of grey hair and a craggy face, 'Norfolk&#x2014;this part of rural Norfolk&#x2014;during the winter months is hardly welcoming.' Despite his words he sounded hopefully questioning.</p><p>'I do not require a welcome.' His companion's deep voice had the trace of an accent. 'I require peace and quiet.' He glanced around him at the pleasant, rather shabby room, apparently impervious to the chill consequence to the house's having lain empty for some weeks. 'Today is the sixth&#x2014;I should like to come in four days' time. I shall have my housekeeper with me, but perhaps you can advise me as to the best means of getting help for the house.'</p><p>'That should be no difficulty, Mr van der Beek. There are several women in the village only too willing to oblige and should you require someone to keep the garden in order there is old Ned Groom who was the gardener here...'</p><p>'Excellent.' Mr van der Beek turned to look out of the window again. He was an extremely tall man, heavily built and still in his thirties, with a commanding nose in a handsome face, a firm mouth and light clear blue eyes. His hair was so fair that it was difficult to see where it was already silvered with grey. 'I will take the house for six months&#x2014;perhaps you would undertake the paperwork.'</p><p>'Of course.' The older man hesitated. 'You mentioned that you required peace and quiet above all else. Might I suggest that you should employ someone: a general factotum, as it were, to relieve you of the tiresome interruptions which are bound to occur&#x2014;the telephone, the tradespeople, bills to be paid, the tactful handling of unwelcome visitors, the care of your house should you wish to go away for a few days.'</p><p>'A paragon, in fact.' Mr van der Beek's voice was dry.</p><p>His companion chose to take him literally. 'Indeed, yes. A local person well known in the village and therefore someone who would not be resented and is the soul of discretion. Your housekeeper need have no fear that her authority will be undermined.'</p><p>Mr van der Beek took his time to consider that. 'It is probably a good idea, but it must be made clear to this person that she&#x2014;it is a she, I presume?&#x2014;will come on a month's trial. I will leave you to make that clear and also to deal with the wages and so forth.'</p><p>'what wages had you in mind?'</p><p>Mr van der Beek waved a large impatient hand. 'My dear fellow, I leave that to your discretion.' He went to the door. 'Can I give you a lift back to Aylsham?'</p><p>His companion accepted eagerly and they left together, locking the door carefully behind them before getting into the dark blue Bentley parked in the drive before the house. Aylsham was something under twenty miles away and they had little to say to each other but, as Mr van der Beek drew up before the estate agent's office in the main street, he asked, 'You have my solicitor's number? Presumably the owner of the house has a solicitor of her own?'</p><p>'Of course. I shall contact them immediately. Rest assured that the house will be ready for you when you return in four days' time.'</p><p>They bade each other goodbye and Mr van der Beek drove himself on to Norwich and on down the A140 before cutting across country to Sudbury and Saffron walden, and, still keeping to the smaller roads, to London. It would have been quicker to have taken the A11 but he had time to spare and he wanted to go over his plans. It had taken careful planning to arrange for six months away from his work as a consultant surgeon; his meticulous notes had reached the stage when they could be transformed into a textbook on surgery and he had spent some weeks searching for a suitable place in which to live while he wrote it. He was fairly sure that he had found it&#x2014;at least, he profoundly hoped so.</p><p>The house agent watched him go and then hurried into his office and picked up the phone, dialled a number and waited impatiently for someone to answer. He didn't give the dry-as-dust voice time to say more than his name. 'George? Dr van der Beek has taken the Martins' house for six months. He wants to move in in four days' time. I'm to engage daily help and when I suggested he might need someone to help the housekeeper he's bringing with him he agreed. Will you see Patience as soon as possible? I didn't tell him that she was the niece of the owners, but in any case I don't think he will notice her; he wants complete quiet while he writes a book. Provided she can keep out of sight and get along with the housekeeper the job's hers...'</p><p>Mr George Bennett coughed. 'It is very short notice&#x2014;the paperwork.'</p><p>'Yes, yes, I know, but the Martins need the money very badly, and besides, Patience can add something to that miserable pension of theirs. It's a godsend.'</p><p>Mr Bennett coughed again. 'I will go and see Patience this afternoon. It is getting a little late; however I do agree with you that this is a chance not to be missed. Was the question of salary raised?'</p><p>'No, but he drives a Bentley and didn't quibble over the rent. I think it might be a good idea if she were to call and see the housekeeper&#x2014;she's coming with Mr van der Beek. I rather fancy that he will leave the running of the house to her.'</p><p>'Very well. I shall go and see Patience now and make sure that everything is in order by the tenth. Shall we leave it to her to engage the help needed?'</p><p>'I should think so. She is well known here and liked. There should be no difficulty.'</p><p>Patience Martin, standing at her bedroom window with a pile of freshly ironed linen in her arms, watched Mr Bennett coming along the street, his elderly person sheltering under an umbrella. The street was narrow and quiet, lined with small flat-fronted houses, all exactly alike, and he was obviously making for her aunts' front door. She put down the linen and ran downstairs in time to prevent him thumping the knocker; her aunts were dozing before their tea and they were too old and frail to be wakened to listen to bad news. For that was what it would be, she reflected; ever since they had lost almost all their capital in a company which had gone bankrupt her aunts regarded old Mr Bennett as the harbinger of bad news...it was he who had warned them that they would have to leave their home&#x2014;sell it or rent it and live on the proceeds, and that frugally. Having lived in moderate comfort for all their lives they had been quite bewildered but uncomplaining, moving to the poky little house he had found for them, quite unable to appreciate the situation. It was Patience who had coped with the difficulties, paid bills and shopped with an economical eye, contriving to give them their glass of sherry before lunch and Earl Grey tea, extravagances offset by the cheaper cuts of meat skilfully disguised and cod instead of halibut...</p><p>She reached the door in time to open it before Mr Bennett could knock, and she ushered him inside. In the narrow hall she took his umbrella, helped him off with his coat, informed him in her quiet voice that her aunts were asleep and ushered him into the sitting-room. It was a small room, overfurnished with her aunts' most treasured pieces but cheaply carpeted and curtained. Mr Bennett took an outsize armchair upholstered in worn brocade and put his briefcase down beside it.</p><p>'If it's bad news perhaps you'll tell me first,' suggested Patience in a matter-of-fact voice.</p><p>Mr Bennett, not to be hurried, studied her as she sat down opposite him. A pity that she was possessed of such unassuming features, he thought; lovely grey eyes fringed with black lashes, long and thick, were the only asset in her face with its too short nose, wide mouth and hair brushed firmly back into a careless bun. Very abundant hair, and silky, but most definitely mouse.</p><p>'My dear Patience, for once I bring good news. Your aunts' house has been let at a very good rent for six months, payable monthly in advance, which should allow you to live without worries for the time being.'</p><p>Patience, thinking of the small pile of bills waiting to be settled, sighed with relief. 'When does the new tenant come?'</p><p>'In four days' time. A Mr van der Beek, a surgeon who needs time to write a book of reference. He emphasises that he must have complete quiet while he is working and has chosen your aunts' house for that reason. He is bringing his housekeeper with him but he has asked Mr Tomkins to find help in the village for the household and, since he was so emphatic about being left undisturbed while he writes, Mr Tomkins suggested that he might like to employ someone to act as a buffer between him and any hindrances&#x2014;the telephone, tradespeople, unwelcome callers and so forth. He agreed to this and Mr Tomkins told him that he knew of just such a person&#x2014;yourself, Patience, although he made no mention of your name or of the fact that you had lived in the house. It is suggested that, if you are agreeable, you might call on the housekeeper and introduce yourself&#x2014;I feel that her goodwill is important&#x2014;so that you may allay any fears she may have concerning her position as head of the domestic staff. Presumably you will come under that category. Your working hours have yet to be arranged, also your pay, but, from what I hear, Mr van der Beek is not a mean man. I shall be seeing him when he comes for the keys and will make sure that you are fairly treated.' Mr Bennett held his hands before him as if in prayer. 'I do not need to advise you to keep a low profile, Patience&#x2014;to be neither seen nor heard should be your aim.'</p><p>'Well, I'll do my best, Mr Bennett, and thank you and Mr Tomkins for all your kindness.

Gerald Nachman presents the stories of the groundbreaking comedy stars of those years, each one a cultural harbinger: <br><br>� Mort Sahl, of a new political cynicism <br>� Lenny Bruce, of the sexual, drug, and language revolution<br>� Dick Gregory, of racial unrest <br>� Bill Cosby and Godfrey Cambridge, of racial harmony <br>� Phyllis Diller, of housewifely complaint<br>� Mike Nichols &amp; Elaine May and Woody Allen, of self-analytical angst and a rearrangement of male-female relations<br>� Stan Freberg and Bob Newhart, of encroaching, pervasive pop media manipulation and, in the case of Bob Elliott &amp; Ray Goulding, of the banalities of broadcasting <br>� Mel Brooks, of the Yiddishization of American comedy<br>� Sid Caesar, of a new awareness of the satirical possibilities of television<br>� Joan Rivers, of the obsessive craving for celebrity gossip and of a latent bitchy sensibility<br>� Tom Lehrer, of the inane, hypocritical, mawkishly sentimental nature of hallowed American folkways and, in the case of the Smothers Brothers, of overly revered folk songs and folklore<br>� Steve Allen, of the late-night talk show as a force in American comedy<br>� David Frye and Vaughn Meader, of the merger of showbiz and politics and, along with Will Jordan, of stretching the boundaries of mimicry<br>� Shelley Berman, of a generation of obsessively self-confessional humor <br>� Jonathan Winters and Jean Shepherd, of the daring new free-form improvisational comedy and of a sardonically updated view of Midwestern archetypes<br>� Ernie Kovacs, of surreal visual effects and the unbounded vistas of video<br><br>Taken together, they made up the faculty of a new school of vigorous, socially aware satire, a vibrant group of voices that reigned from approximately 1953 to 1965. <br><br>Nachman shines a flashlight into the corners of these comedians&#x2019; chaotic and often troubled lives, illuminating their genius as well as their demons, damaged souls, and desperate drive. His exhaustive research and intimate interviews reveal characters that are intriguing and all too human, full of rich stories, confessions, regrets, and traumas. Seriously Funny is at once a dazzling cultural history and a joyous celebration of an extraordinary era in American comedy.</p><p>It's been said that analyzing comedy is a bit like dissecting a frog: you arrive at a greater understanding of the frog but the frog does tend to die in the process. The purpose of Gerald Nachman's <i>Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s</i> is not to provide a laugh riot of his subjects' best punch lines, but rather to explore their lives, careers, and influence. Nachman's scope is impressive. He provides detailed biographies not only of household names Sid Caesar, Lenny Bruce, Bob Newhart, and Woody Allen but also comics like Jean Shepherd, Shelley Berman, and Will Jordan whose legacies have far outpaced their name recognition. Nachman has done his research; the book profiles 26 comedians, each in exhaustive detail, and no fan of this era will feel cheated at the end of its 768 pages. There are plenty of entertaining show biz anecdotes (Sid Caesar throwing a lit cigar at young writer Mel Brooks, Bill Cosby punching out Tommy Smothers) along with tales of the darker sides of Mort Sahl, Jonathan Winters, and others whose private lives were far less amusing than their stage acts. But what makes <i>Seriously Funny</i> so compelling, and its dopey title at least partially forgivable, is the author's meticulous attention to each comedian's imprint on the landscape of comedy itself. And while the jokes cited often seem a bit stale and obvious, it bears noting that they were revolutionary when these comedians first made them. <i>--John Moe</i>Gerald Nachman has for more than forty years covered theater, movies, cabaret, and television for newspapers and magazines.

You may sometimes feel you are reading a furious, Instagram-era updating of Ann Beattie's short stories . . . There&#x2019;s also the crunch of writers like Ian McEwan and Martin Amis in Mr. Jackson&#x2019;s prose. Best of all there&#x2019;s that sense &#x2015; only the excellent ones give it to you &#x2015; that whatever topic the author turns his mental LED lights toward will be powerfully illuminated . . . What makes these stories radiant . . . is how invested Mr. Jackson is in peeling off the rind of life, in getting to the juice . . . &#x2018;The passage of experience back through us&#x2019; &#x2015; that&#x2019;s a powerful line, and it represents what this young writer is capable of delivering, right now and, if fortune smiles, long into the future.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;There are ethics at stake and, more important, crackling and careening Fitzgerald-worthy sentences that gather into Cheeveresque specimens of narrative architecture. Even stories that come apart (deliberately, in the case of 'Metanarrative Breakdown') feel like the work of a writer with several books behind him, instead of none.&#x201d; &#x2015;Boris Kachka, <i>New York</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;</i>Jackson is incredibly funny and amazingly sharp in his observations of regrets and disappointment, and the compelling stories are full of wisdom. This book has a lot of warmth in spite of the cold hard truths they tell. His characters struggle with morality in the face of a world where morals seem no longer worth having, and hopes and dreams are constantly being downgraded until they are simply stories they tell themselves to help them get through the day . . . Jackson deftly shows the nuances of adult consciousness with dark humor and compassion, and this pithy collection is a powerful debut sure to bring him recognition.&#x201d; &#x2015;Liberty Hardy, <i>Electric Literature</i></p><p>&#x201c;Jackson is a virtuosic talent, and his distinctive, maximalist prose style alone will make <i>Prodigals</i> one of the more memorable debuts of 2016 . . .

In its best moments, it makes a persuasive argument for the unique <i>something</i> of its author.&#x201d; &#x2015;MIchael Deagler, <i>The Rumpus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Upwardly mobile, young(ish), and utterly lost: Such are the characters of Jackson's short fiction.

Transcendence-seekers find themselves earthbound as art, drugs, role-playing, and material goods serve as temporary balms for the anomie of modern life. The elusive cure is love, and Jackson nails the way sophisticated, hard-bitten entanglements give way to sudden surges of old-fashioned romance.

His lyric virtuosity is thrilling, his sensibility acute and nuanced, but it was something deeper than either of these things that ultimately compelled me in these stories: It was a genuine sense of searching&#x2015;without irony or apology, with fierce intelligence&#x2015;for what might constitute a meaningful life.&#x201d; &#x2015;Leslie Jamison, author of <i>The Empathy Exams</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Prodigals</i> is elegant and unpredictable.

From <i>Le Palais Id�al</i>, built in a small French village by the mailman Cheval, to the <i>Hubcap Ranch</i> by Litto Damonte of California, to Nek Chand's hundreds of human and animal sculptures made from waste and recycled materials and set in a massive landscaped rock garden in Northwest India, <i>Self-Made Worlds</i> is an international tour of some of the most remarkable manifestations of the idiosyncratic, eccentric glory of the human imagination.</p><p>Carefully conceived, with respectful, sophisticated essays and excellent color photographs, plus an extensive list of folk-art sites, <i>Self-Made Worlds</i> may prove indispensable to aficionados of outsider art, and will be educational for those who are new to it. The sites--minutely decorated, handmade, often monumental temples, grottoes, castles, and towers--range from the famous, graceful <i>Palais Id�al</i> in France, to a Depression-era shack in Louisiana painted with words. Portable outsider art fetches high prices, but as curator Roger Manley writes, all of these obsessive environments, whether about beauty, rage, or sadness, "stem from a deeply felt need for experience that feels honest, authentic, and highly personal."<b>Roger Manley</b> is a photographer, folklorist, curator, and writer based in Durham, North Carolina.

Much more than a reference book, The Keys to American History tells the story of a growing, vibrant democracy through its laws, Supreme Court rulings, treaties, and presidential speeches, from colonial times to the present. Organized chronologically, each document includes a brief introduction and excerpts, and often an image of the original. Most are followed by interesting and relevant historical quotes from books, newspapers, and speeches of their eras, providing a rich and varied framework to understand each document&#x2019;s significance. The more than 60 entries include: � Mayflower Compact � Declaration of Independence � Washington&#x2019;s Farewell Address � Missouri Compromise � Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments � Emancipation Proclamation � Homestead Act � Wilson&#x2019;s Fourteen Points � Brown v. Board of Education � Voting Rights Act � Resignation Speech of Richard Nixon � ...and more By reading the essential documents of American government, and the viewpoints of the leaders and citizens who wrote them, you will gain a profound understanding of the United States and the men and women who built it.</p><p><strong>Richard Panchyk is the author of&nbsp;<i>American Folk Art for Kids</i>, <i>Archaeology for Kids</i>, <i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt for Kids</i>, <i>Galileo for Kids</i>, <i>Our Supreme Court</i>, and<i> World War II&nbsp;for Kids.</i></strong>Grade 7 Up&#x2014;This impressive collection is a valuable resource for gaining a greater appreciation for and understanding of our nation's dynamic history. The 72 entries range chronologically from the foundation of the American colonies with the Great Patent of James I in 1606 to the 2002 Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces in Iraq. The volume documents such monumental episodes as the American Revolution, Civil War, Western Expansion, World War II, and the Civil Rights Movement. It contains all of the documents one would expect, such as the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Gettysburg Address as well as the lesser-known Antiquities Act of 1906, which protects historic national sites. Each document is prefaced with a brief introduction that gives students a reasonable degree of historical context. The author also includes a "What They Were Saying" segment that utilizes quotes of the day related to the documents. Each entry is accompanied by a variety of black-and-white portraits, maps, and facsimiles of the originals. While arguments will abound for the many documents left out, one cannot deny the seminal historical importance of those making the cut. Educators and AP students alike will find this volume valuable.&#x2014;<i>Brian Odom, Pelham Public Library, AL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Your concern is love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You've likely hit a snag, maybe a small one, maybe large. Human intimacy is so complex, so coiled and convoluted, that it's hard not to hit a snag. Most of us hit snags all the time in our dealings with others, especially those we are closest to. So, ifyou've hit a snag, just hang on. Keep up the effort. Anyone who tells you it's easy to stay together over the long haul has never done it. If you're still taking it seriously and working at it, your efforts will pay off as long as you have a plan that makessense. It's not enough just to take it seriously and work at it. Some people work at it their whole lives long and get nowhere. To help your efforts to keep your love alive and your marriage intact, we offer a plan based on what we know works best.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When a couple is in a good place, each partner feels secure and fulfilled. To feel secure and fulfilled in a relationship, both people need to feel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>* that the other person thinks highly of them. * that the other person cares deeply for them. *that the other person thinks they are proficient at something.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Beyond that, for love to become what we all want it to become, a smile should cross your face when you think of your mate. You ought to think of him or her as someone you have fun with, someone you look forward to seeing, someone who for an undefinablereason makes life feel special. You want to feel that he or she casts a glow into your life that makes you feel good, no matter what else might be going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When all goes right, a natural sequence of five steps leads to such happiness in love. Each step should usher in the next, but, as we will later describe, modern life tends to snag each one. The steps are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>1. Attention 2. Time 3. Empathy 4. Connection 5. Play&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Love begins in attention. Love begins when you notice another person. Love starts with a catching of your eye. Be it on some enchanted evening across a crowded room, or via an ad on Match.com, some signal--somehow--draws your attention to one person andnot to another. No one has ever figured out exactly why and how this happens when and where it does--but it does, and has done so since the dawn of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> In today's world, distractions interrupt attention all the time. The basic prerequisite of love--attention--can seem impossible to give or get.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Once you have each other's attention--no small feat--the next step toward love is to sustain that attention over time. Without sustained attention, love cannot grow. On the other hand, too much attention can snuff it out. While some people purport to knowthe right proportions in advance, each love is different, which is why there is no one recipe and why "prescriptions for finding love" offered by "experts" so often fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Giving and receiving attention becomes a kind of dance as love grows. Now you see me, now you don't. Playing hard to get. Don't be too easy. If you want me, you'll have to pursue me. At this stage, attention is often focused on the other in absentia. Resistingpicking up the phone to make the call. Deliberately avoiding the other person while thinking about him or her day and night. Preoccupied by the other person, but keeping a certain distance. This is the dance of developing love.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Once again, our age of distraction can disrupt the dance. If you don't have time to ponder and wonder, if you don't have time to approach and avoid and put your heart into it, then love will falter here, not because you are a mismatch but because you havenot created sufficient focus for love to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Attention given and received in proper measure over time, a recipe that varies from couple to couple, leads to a deeper interest in and a greater knowledge of the other person, which constitutes understanding and empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Mutual empathy creates a connection. It is impossible to overestimate the power of connection at its strongest. It drives life. But it cannot develop if people are unable to sustain attention over time. Such a mundane obstacle--distraction--ruins millionsof potentially intimate relationships in our modern age.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; But if you are able to create genuine connection, you've got it made. This is the great reward of love. In connection, you feel safe enough to become vulnerable. You feel safe enough to let go and to play. Play is the main action of true love. By playwe mean any activity in which your imagination comes alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Play often begets its cousin, celebration. New research shows that more important than being there for your partner when times are tough is being there for your partner when times are good. The study found that being excited and happy for your partnerwhen he or she brings home good news was a stronger predictor of the strength of the relationship than being stalwart when bad news hits.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Being able to play and to celebrate--being able to have fun together--are far more important than most people believe. They are a cornerstone of all great relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As we have mentioned and will continue to show, the conditions of modern life threaten all five of the steps we've named, which in turn threatens the vibrancy and power of your love--not because you are mismatched, not because you are impaired people,but simply because today's world sets unique traps that can derail even the best relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Of course, we don't know exactly how the help you'll find here will help you because we don't know the particulars of your situation. You may be in great distress, or just a little worried. Whatever the case, you probably want to get more from your marriage(or other close relationship) than you are currently getting. This book will help you in that regard. If you follow the suggestions we offer in these pages, it will be impossible for you not to develop a closer and more enjoyable relationship. And don't worry,the suggestions are not at all difficult to implement. You won't have to learn a foreign language or join a new religion. All you really have to do is set aside some time. Not easy, but possible, right? &nbsp; You may believe your marriage is basically good, but it could use a tweak. Or you might feel like the person who once said to Ned, "I know my marriage is just fine . . . until I stop and think about it."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> There is likely love in your marriage, and we will build on that love. But even if you think there is no love, we will help you search out what's positive. At the heart of our method is the identification and development of what's already good. You wouldn'tbe with your partner if you didn't once have love, or something like love, but that love might now not be so easy to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> As one of Ned's patients once said, "My husband and I work so hard to get everything done, we're like a small business, and businesses don't run on love. Earn the money, take care of the kids, keep up the house, do the holidays and birthdays and celebrations,bake the cookies, do the school and homework thing, keep up with the relatives, you know the drill. With all there is to get done, I sometimes ask myself, 'But where's the love?' You know, like, get real, who has time for that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> At times we're simply too busy to pay attention to the people we love the most. We take them for granted. There's just so much to do. You may be exasperated at how difficult it has become to get your spouse's full attention or to find some enjoyable chunksof time for yourselves together, time when you're both fully present.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Life has also become so insecure, so fraught with worry and uncertainty, that it can be difficult to connect romantically. You may feel as if you are handling one crisis after another, or at best, one worry after another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> We do live in worried times. So, you're probably not only looking for deeper love but also for greater stability . . . in a world where neither love nor stability is easy to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> You also may be hoping for some fun. But today, fun often gives way to fear. As you read this, you may be wondering if any of the hopes we've mentioned are realistically possible given the frenzy and anxiety of modern life and all the stuff you have todo just to stay afloat. Marital bliss may seem like a preposterous pipe dream, not an attainable goal. &nbsp; Perhaps marital bliss is hyperbole, but genuine joy in a marriage is a goal that we believe any person can reach. We believe the pipe dream is not preposterous. We will show you what you can do to overcome many of the obstacles marriages and other intimaterelationships face these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> We want to connect with you, no matter where you are emotionally. As we wrote the book, we always imagined your side of the conversation, your concerns, your needs, and we tried to anticipate what you might want to know. We've looked at marriage in a moderncontext, your context.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> One of the most jarring facts about modern life is how angry, contentious, and unfriendly it can be. Thanks to technology, we live in an age of instant gotcha!--an age of nonstop gossip and muckraking streaming endlessly across screens worldwide, an ageof disappearing privacy and mounting mistrust, an age of witty ridicule in which the clever put-down gets attention, while the pat on the back seems hokey and obsolete.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Yet, most of us would like a pat on the back as well as some harmony in our lives. Aren't you tired of exposes, fallen heroes, corrupt leaders, and broken promises? Wouldn't you like...</p><h2>How the West Was Lost: Fifty Years of Economic Folly- and the Stark Choices Ahead</h2><p>In How the West Was Lost, the New York Times bestselling author Dambisa Moyo offers a bold account of the decline of the West&#x20ac;&#x2122;s economic supremacy. She examines how the West&#x20ac;&#x2122;s flawed financial decisions have resulted in an economic and geopolitical seesaw that is now poised to tip in favor of the emerging world, especially China. Amid the hype of China&#x20ac;&#x2122;s rise, however, the most important story of our generation is being pushed aside: America is not just in economic decline, but on course to become the biggest welfare state in the history of the West. The real danger is a thome, Moyo claims. While some countries &#x20ac;&#x201c; such as Germany and Sweden &#x20ac;&#x201c; have deliberately engineered and financed welfare states, the United States risks turning itself into a bloated welfare state not because of ideology or a larger vision of economic justice, but out of economic desperation and short-sighted policymaking. How the West Was Lost reveals</p><p>Dambisa Moyo is the author of <i>Dead Aid</i>. Born and raised in Lusaka, Zambia, Moyo completed a Ph.D. in economics at Oxford University and holds a master&#x2019;s from Harvard University&#x2019;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. She worked for the World Bank as a consultant, and also worked at Goldman Sachs for eight years. In 2009, <i>Time</i> magazine named her one of the &#x201c;100 most influential people in the world.&#x201d; Her writing frequently appears in publications including the <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.PART ONEThe Way It Was1Once Upon a Time in the WestOnce upon a time, the West had it all: the money, the political nous, the military might; it knew where it wanted to go, and had the muscle to get there. Be it Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands or England, this held true for 500 years. However, the story of the West&#x2019;s dominance in the second half of the twentieth century is the story of America.1Whether it was the US troops pouring on to the shores of Normandy with the Allied forces or the&nbsp;<i>Enola Gay</i>&nbsp;dropping the bomb on Hiroshima, by the end of the Second World War the baton of global power (economic, political or military) passed from Great Britain to the United States. While it took almost fifty years for the Cold War to play itself out, for the most part the US firmly maintained its paramount position for the next five decades and into the twenty-first century.Of course, in the prelude to the Second World War, the United States had suffered the consequences of the 1929 Great Depression (by 1933 the value of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was less than 20 per cent of what it had been at its peak in 1929, and US unemployment soared to around 25 per cent) and the trauma and casualties of the First World War. Although it did not end the economic crisis of the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal was an attempt to reconstruct American capitalism, and give the not so invisible hand of the government a new and more dynamic role. At its core America would remain a supporter of free enterprise, but the plan was for government to play a key role in orchestrating, supervising and directing the faltering economy, leading, not following, private enterprise and administering large-scale endeavours. All this&nbsp;would prepare America for and enable it to capitalize on the war that would break the back of Western Europe.2Thus, despite any remaining weaknesses, with the advent of the Second World War America was in a unique position to direct the industrial, military and manufacturing sectors to its best economic advantage. In this sense, the Second World War was not seen simply as a political and military necessity, but as an economic opportunity to which it was ready to respond.For example, in 1941, President Roosevelt signed into law the Lend-Lease Act which would sell, exchange, lease or lend to America&#x2019;s allies any military equipment deemed necessary. From 1941 to 1945, under this programme, mat�riel worth US$50bn (equivalent to US$700bn at 2007 prices) &#x2013; battleships, machine guns, torpedo boats, submarines and even army boots &#x2013; were shipped across the waters to its beleaguered allies. Europe took on a heavy burden of future debt repayments to the US through the Lend-Lease programme (Britain made the final payment of its Lend-Lease loan of US$83.83m on the last day of 2006 &#x2013; fifty years later), and America peaked economically after the war, in the 1950s, as a result. Because of Lend-Lease (the Marshall Plan was, of course, a wholly different proposition) the US had become the best-in-class manufacturer.3America&#x2019;s actions were a marriage of political imperative and economic savvy. The manufacture of goods to be shipped abroad was not just a political act to help the Allies; it also helped boost the US economy. Indeed, the results of this &#x2018;great American intervention&#x2019; were staggering on almost every level. Thanks to the global need for US production, America&#x2019;s sluggish economy was transformed into a manufacturing powerhouse.By the end of 1944, US unemployment had shrunk to just 1.2 per cent of the civilian labour force &#x2013; a record low in its economic history which has never been bettered (at the worst point of the Depression more than 15 million Americans &#x2013; one quarter of the nation&#x2019;s workforce &#x2013; were unemployed). The US GNP grew from US$88.6bn in 1939 to US$135bn in 1944 &#x2013; an 8.8 per cent compounded annual increase in half a decade. All this meant that everything was geared to manufacturing &#x2013; and scientific and technological changes intensified. By the end of the war, the rest of the world was broke: Japan destitute,&nbsp;Europe bankrupt and United Kingdom penniless, leaving the United States as unquestionably&nbsp;<i>the</i>&nbsp;economic force.4In its crudest form, the only thing that America lost in the Second World War was men. And even then, their losses compared to those of other warring countries were small. Out of the more than 72 million people who lost their lives in the war, the United States lost 416,800 &#x2013; 0.32 per cent of its population. But, politically, militarily and economically America won hands down. The war was, in the most perverse sense, a resounding success.America came out of the Second World War hugely rich. As the economic historian Alan Milward notes: &#x2018;the United States emerged in 1945 in an incomparably stronger position economically than in 1941 ... By 1945 the foundations of the United States&#x2019; economic domination over the next quarter of a century had been secured ... [This] may have been the most influential consequence of the Second World War for the post-war world.&#x2019;By the middle of the 1950s America was financing the rebuilding of post-war Europe and beyond, while at the same time establishing itself as the foremost exporter of cultural norms and technological know-how. It was going to be America&#x2019;s century, and indeed it was.Not only had the USA avoided direct collateral damage on its own soil (saving the outlay of potentially billions of dollars to rebuild its own infrastructure), the very fact that America could win the war, bankroll its allies during the war and institute the Marshall Plan (aid to Europe worth US$100bn in today&#x2019;s terms, which was around 5 per cent of the 1948 US GDP) demonstrates just how enormously wealthy the country had become.Christopher Tassava wrote: &#x2018;economically strengthened by wartime industrial expansion ... possessed of an economy that was larger and richer than any other in the world, American leaders determined to make the United States the centre of the post-war world economy.&#x2019; The Cold War would continue for the next fifty years, but it was this strategy that ultimately prevailed. Barely scathed, fantastically rich, no country could come close to the United States. The world was hers.Rising America infused all aspects of society. Such was its strength, its confidence, its energy, that it permeated and infiltrated every sphere of Western-influenced human activity. The ensuing decades, the 1950s&nbsp;and 1960s, seemed to bear this theme out. Politically this was the era of social conscience and the civil rights movement, culturally there was a revolution in music, literature and art, and American innovation dominated in science and technology, putting a man on the moon and further developing the atomic bomb.The success of the Manhattan Project and advances in the nuclear arms race heralded an age when America&#x2019;s scientific and technological mastery seemed unassailable in the West. United States exports increased from US$9,993m in 1950 to US$19,626m in 1960. This expansion in exports in just one decade was supported by the increase in US gross fixed capital formation, which grew from US$58bn in 1950 to US$104bn in 1960.The three decades from the 1950s saw America wield its influence in every quarter. From the great industrial complexes such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Mobil Oil, International Business Machines, United Fruit Company and Dow Chemicals, to the Hollywood film industry and the music business exemplified by Motown, all came to symbolize the power of Americana, at home and abroad. It did not just stop at business.Through the Peace Corps, established in 1961, America stamped its moral authority as it exported its values via its youth to everywhere Americans believed was not like them; with a remit to &#x2018;promote world peace and friendship through a Peace Corps, which shall make available to interested countries and areas men and women of the United States qualified for service abroad and willing to serve, under conditions of hardship if necessary, to help the peoples of such countries and areas in meeting their needs for trained manpower&#x2019;. And, of course, American values were not just exported through the Peace Corps. Militarily, the US invaded Korea, and Vietnam to this day remains the great blot on America&#x2019;s conscience. The fact that America was growing bolder, and wielded unparalleled power outside its borders, was unquestionable.All in all, this was the era that belonged to what the American journalist Tom Brokaw calls the &#x2018;Greatest Generation&#x2019;: the generation of Americans who fought in the Second World War and returned to build America into the greatest country in the world. For the next five decades they appeared to have succeeded &#x2013; America was the epitome&nbsp;of wealth, power and cultural dominance, its tentacles reaching to every part of the globe. The rest of the West was firmly held in America&#x2019;s orbit &#x2013; how could you not be in its grip, mesmerized by its power and brilliance? It was the sun around which other countries all revolved.Good times, bad times, America was undeterred. From the oil spikes of the 1970s, the debt burdens and the Wall Street crash of the 1980s, and even the fall of communism in the 1990s, which would spawn its fiercest economic competitors, America seemed unassailable. Through its military might, its industrial capability, helped by free-market capitalism, and its cultural monopoly, America had planned it that way &#x2013;&nbsp;<i>Made in America</i>&nbsp;was the logo of the times.But fast-forward to today. See how much has changed. Western states are facing untold financial calamity, their populations ageing with few resources to sustain them, much of the necessary political reform remaining politically unpopular, and their economic supremacy susceptible to challenges from around the globe in a way never envisaged before. And while there have been setbacks before, such as America&#x2019;s savings and loans crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, the recent financial crisis and the policies the USA continues to pursue are proof positive that America is fast losing the hold it once had over the rest of the world. It has become a region of financial weakness and economic vulnerability in this, the first decade of the twenty-first century, to such an extent that, like bad blood, it has infected the rest of the Western body politic, making the story of economic decline necessarily one of the West versus a number of emerging upstarts. However, among the countries of the West, there remain good reasons to bet on the US being economically stronger than European countries in years to come.But what exactly, in economic terms, drives growth?THE PILLARS OF GROWTHMuch ado has been made of the seemingly inevitable economic decline of the industrialized West &#x2013; the United States, in particular &#x2013; and the &#x2018;rise of the rest&#x2019;, led by China. While most of this debate has tended&nbsp;to centre on historical patterns of imperialism and strategic and military considerations, canonical models of economic growth also offer a framework that highlights just how the West continues to misallocate the key ingredients necessary for long-term sustainable economic success and growth, to its detriment.The evolution of growth theory has been a fascinating one, and one that cannot adequately be expounded in the short space that this book allows. An earlier incarnation in the economics literature began with the Harrod &#x2013; Domar idea, which identified growth as solely a function of one input &#x2013; capital.In 1956, Robert Solow, an American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built on this one-input model by demonstrating that labour too played a crucial and determinate role in delivering growth. For &#x2018;his contributions to the theory of economic growth&#x2019;, Solow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1987, and for a time the Solow model, which saw growth as determined by capital and labour, remained the backbone of the macroeconomic growth literature for many years.However, it must have come as something of a surprise that when these seemingly logical explanations for growth were subjected to empirical scrutiny, they accounted for only 40 per cent of a country&#x2019;s economic prosperity. There was a missing component; and a large one at that. This hitherto unidentified factor &#x2013; the 60 per cent &#x2013; has come to be known as total factor productivity, a catch-all phrase which encompasses technological development as well as anything not captured by the capital and labour inputs, such as culture and institutions. Thus canonical economic models point to three essential ingredients which determine economic growth: capital, labour, and total factor productivity.&nbsp;5&nbsp;These are the pistons which drive the cylinders of economic growth. Finely tuned and working in unison, they motor an engine of near limitless power.Perhaps nothing illustrates the might, the sheer potency, of these three components coming together better than the American moon landing in July 1969. The gauntlet thrown down by President Kennedy in 1961, to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade, could not have been more ambitious. Goaded by the seemingly more adept Russian space programme, which was first with an object &#x2013; Sputnik-1(1957) &#x2013; first with a living creature &#x2013; Laika the dog (1957) &#x2013; and, of course, first with a man &#x2013; Yuri Gagarin (1961) &#x2013; Kennedy captured the spirit of the times in his famous words: &#x2018;We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.&#x2019;The history of the Apollo programme, its personalities, its spirit of adventure, remains one of the most celebrated moments in American (and world) history, and rightly so.6&nbsp;But it is also the supreme example of the confluence of capital, labour and technology, each at the height of its powers and all of them working as one. America had the capital, it had the labour, and, ultimately, it had the technology. The facts and figures speak volumes.In terms of capital, the costs of the Apollo project were astronomical. The annual budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) increased from US$500m in 1960 to a high point of US$5.2bn in 1965 &#x2013; representing 5.3 per cent of that year&#x2019;s federal budget (5 per cent of today&#x2019;s US budget would be around US$125bn). As a reference point, the Vietnamese war is thought to have cost around US$111bn (US$686bn in 2008 dollars). All told, the final cost of the Apollo project was between US$20bn and US$25bn in 1969 dollars (or approximately US$135bn in 2005 dollars).Cash was only one component of the Apollo challenge. To realize its goal America had to draw upon the two other essentials: labour and technology. Luckily for America, it could.To this end, a huge army of personnel were enlisted. By 1966, NASA&#x2019;s civil service list had grown to 36,000 people from the 10,000 the agency employed in 1960. NASA&#x2019;s space programme would also require that the agency call upon thousands upon thousands of outside technicians and scientists. From 1960 to 1965 individuals working on the programme increased by a factor of 10, from 36,000 to an astonishing 376,000. The more critical point here was not that NASA needed to find such a vast amount of talent, but rather that it could. And where the talent did not exist, NASA created it. Private industries, research institutions and universities provided the majority of these personnel. It was this labour force that would invent and build the technology which would catapult America to the forefront of the space r...</p><h2>Chekhov</h2><p>Describes the Russian master&#39;s life in a full portrait that describes his nightmarish childhood, his early twenties as a doctor and a writer and his struggle with tuberculosis, and his last years when he fell in love for the first time</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)While Troyat's leisurely biography ultimately succumbs to the gloominess of its protagonist, Chekhov's evolution as a writer unfolds here naturally.

Visiting Rome, the Eternal City, made the Russian novelist realize how much he missed borscht. When Stanislavski sent him a telegram praising The Cherry Orchard, Chekhov was depressed by the director's "overestimating it." Afraid of falling in love throughout his life, he married a young actress late but was unable to live with her because of her career and his bad health.

In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it."&#x2014;Maya Angelou</i> <br><br>It is documented that an individual lotus flower can live for a thousand years and that the unfolding petals, when blooming, represent the awakening of the heart. As the national flower of India, the lotus symbolizes both purity and unconditional love. It is a sacred symbol and meaningful to spiritual and religious people throughout the world. What is most enchanting about this captivating little flower is that it blooms directly in the mud. <br><br>I have a genuine passion for stories about people who rose above their painful and traumatic life experiences to create beauty and help others. The stories of those who have overcome great challenges in pursuit of personal freedom are so inspiring. Over the years I have collected many moving biographies that include true accounts from Tibetan and Hindu yogis, mystics, hermits, musicians, shamans, activist, artist, clergy and spiritual masters from diverse spiritual traditions. I am continually reminded about the strength of the human spirit to bloom even in the darkest hour. <br><br>Throughout history, influential leaders and well&#x2013;known spiritual teachers have experienced enormous personal suffering. Overcoming abuse, injustice, poverty and abandonment are common themes in the lives of many great beings. Some suffered at the hands of their own family members; others were targeted for the questions they asked and for the ideas they expressed. <br><br>I have heard hundreds of powerful stories over the last decade of teaching meditation retreats and classes. These stories not only opened my heart but also gave me faith and deeper compassion. Each one of us has a touching story of how we came to be and why we are the person we are today. Some of us are the descendants of slaves and others have fled war torn countries. Many in the west grow up in middle class families that look perfect on the outside yet are filled with violence, abuse and pain. Whether you grew up in a wealthy suburb or in the inner city, each one of us has to overcome our share of pain and personal challenges. <br><br>The Buddha said, "In this human life we will experience the 10,000 joys and 10,000 sorrow of life." No one is free from these experiences. Over time, we learn to grow from the bitter <i>and</i> the sweet. But here is the interesting point: Part of the beauty and mystery of living is that we are in a continuous state of growth, exactly like the lotus flower. Often the difficult challenges we experience early in life inform and ultimately inspire us. <br><br><b>Living in the Mud</b><br><br>Like all those before me, I started out with numerous challenges to overcome. I came screaming into the world on December 26, 1973 at St. Mary&#x2019;s county hospital in Long Beach, California. My birth was definitely not a celebrated and magical moment; in fact, it was quite the opposite. My parent&#x2019;s rocky relationship completely unraveled while my mother was pregnant with me. My parents fought day and night throughout my mother&#x2019;s pregnancy, so it&#x2019;s no surprise that I was reported to be the world&#x2019;s grumpiest baby, prone to frequent tantrums with ear&#x2013;splitting screams of rage. My mother always blamed herself for my grumpy disposition&#x2014;she attributed it to all the fights her and my father had while she was carrying me. <br><br>My parents met in the late 1960s in Long Beach, California, while crashing on the sofa of a mutual friend name Billie. Billie had a good heart. She was also a well&#x2013;known drug dealer and prostitute. My father had just gotten out of prison where he had served a one&#x2013;year sentence on a check forgery charge. My mother had just left her first husband, whom she had married in Tijuana, Mexico at the age of 16. They were both down&#x2013;and&#x2013;out and looking for a loving place to call home. Within a couple of days they were madly in love and running off together on a new adventure. They were both curious about spirituality, especially my father; he was interested in metaphysics, meditation, and eastern philosophy. <br><br>My parents took off in an old Cadillac, excited about their spiritual quest to come. During a road trip to Reno, Nevada, they decided to get married on a whim. This presented numerous challenges because my father is a dark&#x2013;skinned African American man and my mother is Caucasian. An interracial couple was still very controversial in the late sixties and both of them were exposed to hatred and racism on a daily basis. <br><br>Despite their initial optimism, they encountered constant difficulties and unforeseen challenges. Neither of them had much formal education, so unemployment and financial problems kept them moving from place to place, stuck in a very transient life style. In addition to those challenges, they both grew up in homes where they suffered severe child abuse at the hands of their fathers. Today, they would have been diagnosed with post&#x2013;traumatic stress disorder. Sadly, their abusive childhoods informed their lives, but so like many others they carried the weight of their trauma as best they could. My mother was my father&#x2019;s second marriage. While still a teenager himself, he fathered two children during his first marriage, a daughter who died tragically falling down a flight of stairs and a son whom he saw on rare occasions. <br><br>My father was strongly against having more children because of the failure of his first marriage. My mother, however, had her own ideas: She desperately wanted a family of her own. In spite of my father&#x2019;s resistance, my sister arrived first; I was born two years later. This put enormous tension on their fragile relationship. The stress of having more children, racism and financial pressure bore down on my parent&#x2019;s relationship, which began to quickly disintegrate. My father began spending more nights out in the streets hustling, doing drugs, partying and seeing other women. He eventually began disappearing for longer and longer periods of time; when I was finally born he had pretty much all but abandoned his small family. <br><br>After I was born we moved to Bellflower, California, a low&#x2013;income neighborhood snuggled between east Long Beach and Compton. My earliest memories were of our large, concrete apartment building surrounded by inner city chaos. I grew accustomed to the sounds of gunshots, police sirens and helicopters buzzing throughout the night. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to play outside often so my sister and I spent many joyful hours jumping up and down on an old, green sofa in our tiny living room, while eating cinnamon toast. My mother worked as much as she could, however, there never seemed to be enough money, so we received state aid and food stamps to get by. In spite of the stress and difficulties, my mother was a very loving, strong and kind-hearted person who always dreamed of a better life for us. <br><br>This is where my story all began and it&#x2019;s a common one: Many of us born into difficult, even dangerous situations with unprepared parents. When we reflect on our personal stories, it might feel like we might be stuck in the mud forever, but this is never the case. No matter who you are or where you come from you, like the lotus you can begin to bloom. Whatever has happened in your life up until this point does not affect your ability to blossom NOW. There is no need for shame; in fact, learning to embrace your history, identity and ancestry is part of the first step. It&#x2019;s a part of our growing process. Many of the most inspired and awakened people who currently live and walk on this planet have also bloomed in the mud. For the mass majority of humanity this is usually the start of the journey, so let&#x2019;s begin.</p><h2>An Army at Dawn : The War in North Africa, 1942-1943</h2><p>The liberation of Europe and the destruction of the Third Reich is a story of courage and enduring triumph, of calamity and miscalculation. In this first volume of his &#34;Liberation Trilogy&#34;, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, &#34;An Army at Dawn&#34; follows the British and American armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery and Rommel.</p><p>In <i>An Army at Dawn,</i>, a comprehensive look at the 1942-1943 Allied invasion of North Africa, author Rick Atkinson posits that the campaign was, along with the battles of Stalingrad and Midway, where the "Axis ... forever lost the initiative" and the "fable of 3rd Reich invincibility was dissolved." Additionally, it forestalled a premature and potentially disastrous cross-channel invasion of France and served as a grueling "testing ground" for an as-yet inexperienced American army. Lastly, by relegating Great Britain to what Atkinson calls the status of "junior partner" in the war effort, North Africa marked the beginning of American geopolitical hegemony. Although his prose is occasionally overwrought, Atkinson's account is a superior one, an agile, well-informed mix of informed strategic overview and intimate battlefield-and-barracks anecdotes. (Tobacco-starved soldiers took to smoking cigarettes made of toilet paper and eucalyptus leaves.) Especially interesting are Atkinson's straightforward accounts of the many "feuds, tiffs and spats" among British and American commanders, politicians, and strategists and his honest assessments of their--and their soldiers'--performance and behavior, for better and for worse. This is an engrossing, extremely accessible account of a grim and too-often overlooked military campaign. <i>--H.

She cannot make them be friends or companions or even cohorts in crime. But, if she's very lucky, they find sisterhood for themselves and have one true ally for life. My daughters did not seem likely candidates for sisterly love. They are as different as night and day, and as contrary as any two girls living under the same roof can possibly manage.</p> <p>My youngest daughter, Laura, is smart, athletic and good at most everything she tries. But for her, friendships are tricky. When, at seven years old, she was thrust into the world of lunch pals and sleepovers, she struggled to survive.</p> <p>Catherine, on the other hand, sits at the top of the elementary school pecking order. A bright, popular and beautiful fifth-grader, she is usually surrounded by a bevy of adoring girlfriends. When you are in second grade, a word or nod from a fifth-grade girl is the greatest thing that can happen. But Catherine and her friends seldom noticed her sister's valiant attempts to be accepted.</p> <p>One hectic morning, while getting ready for school, both girls began begging for a new hairstyle. Sighing, I gathered brushes, combs and pins and quickly created new looks. I braided Laura's wispy locks into a snazzy side-braid. I combed Catherine's shiny black hair into a sleek French twist. They twirled in front of the mirror, pleased with what I'd done. </p> <p>Laura bounced out the door, swinging her braid proudly. But at school, one girl pointed at her and whispered to the other girls. Then the girl walked up to Laura and asked in a scathing tone, "What's with the stinking braid?"</p> <p>Laura crumbled. After getting permission from her teacher, she went to the bathroom, where she sat and cried in an empty stall. Then, she splashed cold water on her face and bravely returned to the classroom-braid intact. </p> <p>That afternoon, she broke my heart with her sad tale. How could I have sent her out wearing a stinking braid? How could I have set her back in her meager attempts to fit in with the other girls? I fought back my tears as I drove my girls home. Hearing her sister's sorrow, Catherine sat in stony silence, and as I often do, I wished they had the kind of bond that would allow them to reach out to each other. I barely noticed Catherine spent more time on the phone than usual that evening. </p> <p>The next afternoon, when I pulled to the front of the carpool line, I discovered a small miracle had occurred. There stood Laura, surrounded by the smartest, cutest, most popular fifth-grade girls. My tiny daughter glowed with utter astonishment as they twirled her around, complimented her and focused a brilliant light of attention upon her. And, to my amazement, every single one wore a side-braid, exactly like the one Laura had worn the day before. Ten stinking braids, I thought, as I tried to swallow the lump lodged in my throat. "I don't know what happened!" exclaimed Laura, clamoring into the van. "I looked up, and all the girls were wearing my braid." She grinned all the way home, arms wrapped around skinny knees, reliving her short life's happiest moment. </p> <p>I glanced at Catherine in the rearview mirror and I think she winked at me. I'm not sure.</p> <p><i>Carolyn Magner Mason<br> 2002 Carloyn Magner Mason<br> </i></p> <p>2002. All rights reserved.

As patrons of the arts, the Vanderbilts certainly had their lapses, but what family, including their Tuscan counterpart, would not, in amassing so gargantuan a pile? Edith Wharton, their severest critic, wrote that they were entrenched &#39;in a sort of Thermopylae of bad taste, from which apparently no force on earth can dislodge them,&#39; but today art critics are becoming more aware of how many fine things were included in the Vanderbilt treasures. Perhaps their greatest fault in taste lay in their seeming inability to dispense with any of their artifacts, even in their largest houses. Beauty can be lost even in a clutter of beauty. The whole is not necessarily greater than its parts.&#34; - Louis Auchincloss, from the Introduction</p><p>This loosely written and poorly edited survey of the 13 great houses built by the eight children of Cornelius "Commodore" Vanderbilt's eldest son is part potted social history, part architectural history, and part personal biography. After an introductory chapter on the family antecedents, the book consists of a chapter on each of the houses--Biltmore, Shelburne, the Breakers, Marble House, and others less well known--that the third generation of wealth erected in what Mark Twain labeled "the gilded age." The illustrations, many of the period, are fascinating, but the text is superficial in content and uncertain in tone. Typos, layout mistakes, and an absence of editing make this a bad book on a good topic.

On Lies, Secrets, and Silence is an extraordinary sort of travel diary, documenting Adrienne Rich&#39;s journeys to the frontier and into the interior. It traces the development of one individual consciousness, &#39;playing over such issues as motherhood, racism, history, poetry, the uses of scholarship, the politics of language.&#39; Rich has written a headnote for each essay, briefly discussing the circumstances of its writing.Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes a National Book Award for poetry for Tonight, No Poetry Will Serve, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant in 1994, and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for Diving Into the Wreck. That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s other volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2006, Rich was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.</p><h2>I Believe in Music: Hardcover</h2><p>(Book).

In the 100 years since the Wright brothers&#39; first powered flight, aviation has witnessed many memorable events. From record-breaking flights and aerial warfare, to advances in aircraft design and the race for space, Flight covers the most memorable moments in the history of aviation. Describing the feats of the brave men and women who piloted the early flying machines, to the pioneers of long-distance flight and the test pilots who ushered in the jet age, Flight is a gripping narrative of humankind&#39;s quest to conquer the skies and explore space. Loaded with spectacular full-color photographs, dramatic first-hand accounts, and fact-filled profiles on a huge range of aircraft, this is an enthralling account of a century of innovation and adventure.</p><p>The Smithsonian Institution's National Air &amp; Space Museum maintains the largest collection of air and spacecraft in the world. It is also a vital center for research into the history, science, and technology of aviation and space flight. R.G. Grant has published more than 20 books on social life and military conflict in the 20th century. His works include a biography of Winston Churchill, a history of the Berlin Wall, and a study of the bombing of Hiroshima and NagasakiThis sweeping compendium of milestones in 20th-century aviation history is published in association with the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which may account for its rigorous attention to detail. Grant (The Berlin Wall) offers a wealth of supportive information to complement his engagingly written text. Succinct offset biographies sketch the lives and contributions of aviation's pioneers (both men and women), scientists, promoters, businessmen, barnstormers, racers, designers and manufacturers, aces (from World War I to Vietnam), and astronauts and cosmonauts. Fascinating sidebars also treat early flight, assorted inventions, famous air races (1910-39), the gradual transformation of the role of the fighter pilot, the evolution of aerial weaponry, training programs, navigational technology, aerial exploration, landmark altitude and long-distance flights, Zeppelin travel, power plants, Hitler's jet and rocket programs, the breaking of the sound barrier, the Cold War space race, and America's current shuttle program. The impressive illustrations include over 300 gorgeous, full-color profiles of the world's major military and civilian aircraft and space vehicles. The result is a work of greater overall scope and depth than Bill Gunston's Aviation: The First 100 Years.

National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Unless you're a vampire, you know that garlic is a critical element in good eating. For most people, this knowledge comes from happy experience with garlic-laced cuisines (and what notable culinary tradition is without it?), not book learning, and not working the fields to produce the aromatic bulb. For Stanley Crawford, the love of garlic comes from both scientific study and three decades of labor in the field to produce the exquisite bulbs, knowing full well that "if you grow good garlic people will love you for it." Crawford deserves similar affection for <i>Garlic Testament</i>, a lyrical memoir of his work as a farmer in northern New Mexico, one that combines autobiography, gardening hints, and a quiet philosophy of life. "Farming and writing are both labors ... conducted on flat planes in relative solitude," he writes, but in this fine book--which compares well with the work of fellow farmer-writer Wendell Berry--Crawford opens his gate and invites our company. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>"A treasure trove of planting lore [as] pungently powerful as [Crawford's] crop of choice."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Hawk: A New Novel Vlad Taltos</h2><p><p>Years ago, Vlad Taltos came to make his way as a human amidst the impossibly tall, fantastically long-lived natives of the Dragaeran Empire.

We were in the library of Castle Black, having just finished doing something dangerous and preposterous, and our host, Morrolan, pulled out a case of a really good white wine from Descin. Sethra Lavode, the Enchantress of Dzur Mountain, was there, as was Morrolan&#x2019;s cousin Aliera, and I think the Necromancer, and of course Daymar.</p> <p>The more we talked, the more we drank; and the more we drank, the less I can recall of what we said. But I remember that at some point in there they started telling stories of the various rites of passage among the different Houses. You know, some tests or things you go through before you&#x2019;re considered fully part of the House, or maybe an adult, or officially a bloodthirsty asshole, or whatever it is your House values.</p> <p>All the Great Houses except the Teckla and the Jhereg have them, and they&#x2019;re all different. The Dragonlords&#x2014;Morrolan and Aliera&#x2014;told of having to make tough command decisions during a combat exercise. Sethra recounted different tests among the Dzur, the Tiassa, and the Iorich across much of history, which she could do, having lived through all of history and a little more besides. I talked about a couple of traditions among Eastern witches; including the one that had got me the jhereg that was, at that moment, sitting on my shoulder telepathically making smart-ass remarks.</p> <p>Daymar turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining storyteller for a guy who never seemed sure where his imagination stopped and reality started. I don&#x2019;t remember a lot about what he said, but I remember enjoying it. And there is one piece that must have stuck with me. I know this because years later I abruptly remembered it, setting off, well, I guess everything that I&#x2019;m about to tell you.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s the bit of what he said that I suddenly remembered: &#x201c;I had to hide from the Orb while I did it.&#x201d; I must have been pretty drunk not to react at the time, but&#x2014;jumping forward to now, to a time when I was on the run from the Jhereg and concentrating all of my energy on living through each day&#x2014;I woke up from a light sleep and said aloud, &#x201c;Verra&#x2019;s tits and toenails!&#x201d;</p> <p>I sat there in a dank, windowless, cell-like room, with my back against the stone wall, and let things play out in my head. Then I stood up and started pacing. There wasn&#x2019;t enough space in the room, so I went out and started pacing up and down the hall.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d;</i> I said into Loiosh&#x2019;s mind after a while. <i>&#x201c;I might have something.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Think soup and bed rest will cure it, Boss?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Something that might get me out of trouble with the Jhereg.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>Silence in my mind. Then, <i>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;What&#x2014;&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Find Daymar. Have him meet me across the street,&#x201d;</i> I said.</p> <p>Loiosh didn&#x2019;t reply; I opened the door at the far end of the hallway and he flew out, followed by his mate, Rocza. A moment later she returned and hissed at me. That was another time when I was glad she and I couldn&#x2019;t speak with each other, although, really, she was communicating just fine.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t know. If I hadn&#x2019;t been on my way to see my kid, I might not have decided it was time to risk everything. I wonder. I mean, it probably wouldn&#x2019;t have changed things, but that&#x2019;s the sort of thing you wonder about later.</p> <p>So, yeah. A couple of days before I suddenly woke up with that memory of Daymar, I was on my way to visit my kid at the home of my estranged wife in South Adrilankha when someone tried to kill me. Loiosh warned me. <i>&#x201c;Boss,&#x201d;</i> he said. <i>&#x201c;There are two people up ahead, hiding. They&#x2019;re Dragaerans. I think there&#x2019;s a Morganti weapon.&#x201d;</i> He didn&#x2019;t actually say, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re waiting to kill you,&#x201d; but he also didn&#x2019;t tell me that water is wet and rocks are hard (nor that water is hard, but never mind that for now).</p> <p>I stopped. This part of South Adrilankha was full of cottages set at varying distances back from a narrow road dotted with large deciduous trees. I figured the trees were planted there so their leaves would catch the stench of the slaughterhouses and keep it close to you. That way, even on days like this when the breeze wasn&#x2019;t from the south, you had a little reminder of why you hated this part of the city. I stepped behind one of the trees and spoke to Loiosh.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Goodness,&#x201d;</i> I said. <i>&#x201c;Whatever could they want?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Imperial representatives, wanting to present you with an island kingdom?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just what I was thinking they were.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;As you would say: Heh.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;How far ahead?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Fifty yards or so.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;In other words, right in front of Cawti&#x2019;s house?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Yeah. Also&#x2014;&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Another guy, leaning against the house itself.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make any&#x2014;&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Colors of the House of the Dragon, Boss, and a gold half-cloak.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;That makes perfect sense.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>It was a dilemma. The assassins&#x2014;I had no doubt they were assassins because I&#x2019;m not an idiot&#x2014;were in front of the house my kid lived in. I could come around behind them and hunt the hunters, but that would bring the whole mess to my front door, in a fairly literal way. Yeah, Cawti was there, and she could certainly handle herself. But murder tends to get noticed, sometimes even in South Adrilankha. And there was a Dragonlord, an Imperial Guardsman, on duty. That would mean the Jhereg couldn&#x2019;t get me, here and now; but I couldn&#x2019;t get them, either. Put it another way: Much as I wanted to take them down, it seemed like the best thing would be to just walk away.</p> <p>But if they were watching my house (dammit, <i>not</i> my house; my ex-wife&#x2019;s house), it meant it would never be safe to visit there.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Boss, it never</i> has <i>been safe to visit there.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Yeah, I know.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;And why the guardsman?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Norathar. I mean, the Dragon Heir, not the boy. I&#x2019;ll bet you six dead teckla she arranged for that gold-cloak to be there, to keep Cawti and the boy safe.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I chuckled a bit to myself as I imagined just what Cawti must have said about being protected. I&#x2019;d have loved to have eavesdropped on that conversation. Probably psychic, though. Too bad you can&#x2019;t listen in on someone else&#x2019;s psychic conversations.</p> <p>For now, I kept myself hidden, I studied, and considered. I discovered that my right hand had gone to the hilt of Lady Teldra, about whom more later. I relaxed and let the hand fall to my side while I thought.</p> <p>Yeah, sometimes I think. It isn&#x2019;t what I do best, but occasionally I just give it a shot anyway.</p> <p>If I were the assassins, and there was an Imperial Guardsman right in front of where I thought the target would be, what would I do? That was easy&#x2014;find a different place to &#x201c;take my shot,&#x201d; in the idiom of my homeland. Where? Well, ideally, a place where there weren&#x2019;t any Imperial Guardsmen? But okay, if I wanted the guy really, really bad, and I couldn&#x2019;t find anywhere else? Maybe&#x2014;<i>maybe</i>&#x2014;I&#x2019;d try to arrange for the guard to be distracted long enough for me to make the attempt anyway. It would be complicated, tricky, expensive, and risky; but maybe.</p> <p>Well, no, to be more precise, <i>I</i> wouldn&#x2019;t do that, but it was possible these guys would. After all, there were two of them doing a job that usually only one did&#x2014;assassins usually work alone. Having two of them waiting for me was, to be sure, an honor of sorts. But like the guy on the Executioner&#x2019;s Star said: Except for the honor, I&#x2019;d have preferred to skip the ceremony.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;What do you think, Loiosh?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;You know what I think, Boss. You should walk away right now.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Yeah. Talk me into it.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;If I had to talk you into it, you wouldn&#x2019;t be asking me to. Let&#x2019;s go already.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>There was nothing to say to that. Loiosh landed on my right shoulder, Rocza on my left, and I turned and walked back the way I&#x2019;d come. After a few hundred feet, I stepped off into an alley, and took back streets all the way to the Stone Bridge, which leads back to the City. Instead of taking the bridge, however, I cut north on a street whose name I never learned. In a few minutes, I saw a dilapidated building off to my right that had the vertical parallel lines&#x2014;drawn or painted above the door&#x2014;that indicate, in the Easterners&#x2019; district, a place that lets out rooms for the night.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;The street would have fewer vermin than that place,&#x201d;</i> said Loiosh. <i>&#x201c;And probably be safer.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t answer him.</p> <p>I paid for a room from the fat, grizzled woman in the chair next to the door. She grunted a number at me.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are there actually numbers on the rooms?&#x201d; I asked her.</p> <p>She squinted at me, and opened her mouth. She didn&#x2019;t have many teeth.</p> <p>&#x201c;Up the stairs, second door on the right. If you have a bag, carry it yourself,&#x201d; she added, which wasn&#x2019;t necessary because she could see I didn&#x2019;t have one, and because I wouldn&#x2019;t have trusted her with it if I had. It was the kind of place the lower order of prostitutes avoid as too disgusting.</p> <p>She glowered at me, I think just on principle; but when I started moving, my cloak shifted, and she could see the hilt of my rapier, and she stopped glowering, and I knew if we had any more conversation she would be very polite.</p> <p>The room was about what you&#x2019;d expect. I tested the bed. I&#x2019;d slept in worse. Of course, that was on the ground, but still. There was an empty water pitcher, which indicated a pump room nearby, so it could have been much worse. There was a window big enough for Loiosh and Rocza to fit through, but no way to close it, or even to block any light that came through unless I drove a nail into the wall above it and hung my cloak there. I considered going out to find a blacksmith. There was a chair and a small table with a washbasin on it. The chair looked safe, so I sat in it, and relaxed for half an hour or so while I considered nails and other matters.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Boss, there really is a lot of insect life in here.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I grunted and stood up.</p> <p>You could say that I was unable to perform any witchcraft because of the amulet I wore that made me invisible to magical detection, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be strictly true. I took a selection of herbs from my pouch, put them in the tin water basin, and lit them. Just because I couldn&#x2019;t invoke any power didn&#x2019;t mean I couldn&#x2019;t use what I knew, and what I knew was how to drive at least most of the insect life out of the room. After that, it was just a matter of leaving the room for a couple of hours while the herbs did&#x2014;</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Boss! There&#x2019;s someone in the hall.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I froze, my hand on the doorknob.</p> <p>There&#x2019;d been occasional people walking up and down the hallway all along, but Loiosh wouldn&#x2019;t have mentioned this one without reason.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Check the window.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>He flapped over there, stuck his head out. <i>&#x201c;No good, Boss; two of them out there.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Two? Two outside, and one inside? Three of them? What is this organization coming to?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;There might be more than one outside the door, Boss. I can&#x2019;t tell for sure.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I looked around for a place to hide. I mean, there wasn&#x2019;t one, and I knew there wasn&#x2019;t one, but I looked anyway, because you do. I could jump out the window where I knew there were two of them, and, with any luck, Loiosh and Rocza could distract them while I recovered from the jump enough to, you know, not die. But aside from any other problems, I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could fit through the window. I could wait and deal with the unknown or unknowns who, I presumed, were getting ready to smash my door down, and&#x2014;well, same problem. If it were me on the other side of the door, I&#x2019;d blow the damned thing up and rush in before the dust settled. Crap. If I were in a farce, I&#x2019;d hide under the bed. In a play full of exciting fake violence I&#x2019;d&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Hmmmm.</p> <p>The room didn&#x2019;t have a real ceiling, just bare rafters with the roof a few feet above them.</p> <p><i>&#x201c;Boss, seriously? That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re going with?&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;Got a better idea?&#x201d;</i></p> <p>I stood on the bed frame and jumped, catching hold of one of the rafters. I pulled myself up, which wasn&#x2019;t as easy as it should have been. Either I&#x2019;d gained weight since coming back to Adrilankha, or else the extra hardware I&#x2019;d picked up recently was weighing me down. But I got there, stood on the beam, and put my other hand on the slanting roof for balance.</p> <p>Loiosh and Rocza flew up next to me and door blew in, almost knocking me off the beam in spite of my grip.</p> <p>From above, all I could tell was that there were two of them, one of them holding a dagger and the other a Morganti broadsword. I mean, you don&#x2019;t exactly <i>see</i> that it&#x2019;s Morganti, unless you&#x2019;re in light bright enough to notice that there&#x2019;s no reflection from the metal, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. You know it&#x2019;s a Morganti weapon. Even wearing a Phoenix Stone amulet, which pretty much makes you deaf to both sorcery and psychic phenomena, if you&#x2019;re that close to a Morganti weapon, you know.</p> <p>They charged into the room ready to kill, stopped, looked around. I took a deep breath and a grip on the rafter. After a moment, they went over to the window and looked out on the street. The one with the dagger shrugged his shoulders. The other one turned around, looked up, saw me, opened his mouth, and got both of my boots in his teeth. He didn&#x2019;t go out the window, which is what I&#x2019;d been hoping for, but I could hear the crack when his head hit the sill; I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d have to worry about him for a bit.</p> <p>The other one turned to me. I&#x2019;d fallen to the ground after my heroic leap, so I rolled back out of range while Loiosh and Rocza got in the assassin&#x2019;s face in a very literal, biting, fill-him-with-jhereg-venom kind of way. I got to my feet and recovered my balance, then I threw the basin of burning herbs in his face, then drew a dagger and stabbed him in the throat, angled up to get the base of his brain. In a move that had become almost automatic, I stepped to the side to avoid the stuff that would require laundry services if it got on my clothes. The other guy seemed to be unconscious. I stabbed him in the throat too, just to be sure. I left the knife there.</p> <p>Then I stood in front of the window and looked down at the other two, spreading my hands in a &#x201c;now what?&#x201d; gesture.</p> <p>They turned and walked away.</p> <p>What I really wanted to do next, just for effect, was to go back downstairs and demand a new room of the landlady on the basis that mine was full of vermin, the washbasin was dented, and the door was broken. But I didn&#x2019;t. I went back down the stairs and, ignoring her, walked out the door. If she had any presence of mind and a few connections, she&#x2019;d sell that Morganti broadsword on the gray market for enough to retire on.</p> <p>I took a sharp left, taking me off in a different direction than the two button-men had gone.</p> <p>I wondered how they&#x2019;d found me.</p> <p>After a couple of blocks I stopped, rested against a building, and let myself shake for a while. I don&#x2019;t know, maybe two minutes, maybe five.</p> <p>Evening was coming on.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d been in Adrilankha for several months; too long to be in one place with assassins after you. Loiosh was no longer bothering to tell me how stupid it was for me to hang around. I couldn&#x2019;t argue with him, even before the Jhereg stationed outside Cawti&#x2019;s place confirmed it. The price on my head was high enough to be tempting to anyone.</p> <p>I had to get out of the city, but I didn&#x2019;t want to.

Who else would send all-staff emails to smoke out the dumbest people on her show? Now, in this new collection of original essays, the #1 bestselling author of <em>Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea</em> delivers one laugh-out-loud moment after another as she sets her sights on the ridiculous side of childhood, adulthood, and daughterhood. <br><br> Family moments are fair game, whether it's writing a report on Reaganomics to earn a Cabbage Patch doll, or teaching her father social graces by ordering him to stay indoors. It's open season on her love life, from playing a prank on her boyfriend (using a ravioli, a fake autopsy, and the Santa Monica pier) to adopting a dog so she can snuggle with someone who doesn't talk. And everyone better duck for cover when her beach vacation turns into matchmaking gone wild. Outrageously funny and deliciously wicked, <em>Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang</em> is good good good good! <br><br> Chelsea Handler on...<br><br> - Being unpopular: "My parents couldn't have been more unreasonable when it came to fads or clothes that weren't purchased at a pharmacy." <br><br> - Living with her boyfriend:<strong> </strong>"He's similar to a large toddler, the only difference being he doesn't cry when he wakes up."<br><br> - Appreciating her brother:<strong> </strong>"He's a certified public accountant, and <em>I</em> have a real life."<br><br> - Arm-wrestling a maid of honor: "It wasn't her strength that intimidated me.

Comedienne, talk show host and daring author Handler (Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea) indulges her fans with a new compilation of shockingly direct essays, from which she emerges as a scheming farceur with an expansive range of practical jokes and winning sarcasm, pulled off beautifully against (and with help from) her closest friends and family (including her boyfriend, the CEO of the E! television network that employs her). Handler spins a deliriously sticky web of running jokes while suckering the gullible, again and again, with made-up stories of her transgendered friend, a ludicrous movie deal, and her infamous personal pilot. Never shy, Handler finds room for even more irreverent honesty regarding sex-including her earliest encounters with male genitalia and with "the feeling"-and also lets readers in on her family life, including a family dinner that ends with her missing brother found intoxicated, naked, and celebrating on a dock in the early morning hours. Whether Handler is plotting to get her father committed or convincing her dog never to "shadoobie" in her presence, her essays are packed with enough laugh-out-loud moments to rival a first-rate stand-up act.

Is a Pound of Cure comes almost 30 years later, as people around the world have increasingly awakened to the efficacy of natural remedies . . . and at a time when the American health-care system is increasingly failing the public.In this fascinating book, Dr. D&#x2019;Adamo exhorts us to take responsibility for our own health and prevent chronic degenerative diseases using his newest discoveries, which has given him the opportunity to treat more than 50,000 patients. He explains which foods and exercises are right for each of us, what assets and liabilities we&#x2019;re born with, and how our minds can work to better process information. This book contains Dr. D&#x2019;Adamo&#x2019;s most up-to-date and comprehensive teachings; and includes recipes, exercise regimens, and a panoply of natural therapies he recommends to the patients at his institute.Just An Ounce of Prevention is the consummate statement on natural healing from this generation&#x2019;s most original naturopath. As Dr. D&#x2019;Adamo writes: "We are all here for a purpose, and we can only aspire to our physical and spiritual fulfillment when the body is healthy and the mind clear. Blood types are a Truth of Nature and, if followed, will provide a person with the physical and spiritual health that Nature has intended for them."</p><p>Dr. James L. D&#x2019;Adamo, N.D. D.N.B, is the originator of the world-famous Blood Type Diet and director of the D&#x2019;Adamo Institute for the Advancement of Natural Therapies. Trained in the United States, Germany, and Switzerland, Dr. D&#x2019;Adamo revolutionized natural medicine more than 50 years ago with his discovery of the correlation between a person&#x2019;s blood type and his or her dietary and exercise requirements. His landmark books, One Man&#x2019;s Food . . . is someone else&#x2019;s poison (1980) and The D&#x2019;Adamo Diet (1989), rejected standardized approaches of treatment and passionately called for diagnosis and care based on the individual.Dr. D&#x2019;Adamo began his practice in New York and has also worked in London, Montreal, Antwerp, and Chihuahua, Mexico, treating over 50,000 patients, including many celebrities. He currently works at offices in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Toronto, Canada, where he and his team of naturopathic specialists provide the most comprehensive natural health care in North America.The diet secret of many enviable Hollywood stars&#39; bodies...Cheryl Tweedy admits she is a fan too.

You know what it is. . . . You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i><br><i><br></i>Dr. Martin Luther King received this demand in an anonymous letter in 1964. He believed that the letter was telling him to commit suicide. Who wrote this anonymous letter? The FBI. And the man behind it all was J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI's first director. In this unsparing exploration of one of the most powerful Americans of the twentieth century, accomplished historian Marc Aronson unmasks the man behind the Bureau- his tangled family history and personal relationships; his own need for secrecy, deceit, and control; and the broad trends in American society that shaped his world. Hoover may have given America the security&nbsp;<i>it</i>&nbsp;wanted, but the secrets he knew gave him&nbsp;&#x2014; and the Bureau &#x2014; all the power&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;wanted. Using photographs, cartoons, movie posters, and FBI transcripts,&nbsp;<i>Master of Deceit</i>&nbsp;gives readers the necessary evidence to make their own conclusions. Here is a book about the twentieth century that blazes with questions and insights about our choices in the twenty-first.&nbsp;Back matter includes an epilogue, an author&#x2019;s note, source notes, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p><b>Marc Aronson</b>&nbsp;has a doctorate in American history and is a member of the graduate faculty in the library school at Rutgers.

Marc Aronson lives in New Jersey.MASTER OF DECEIT is a masterpiece of historical narrative, with the momentum of a thrilling novel and the historical detail of the best nonfiction... This is as much about <i>how </i>history is written as it is about Hoover and his times... Written with the authority of a fine writer with an inquiring mind, this dramatic story is history writing at its best.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>Aronson&#x2019;s stimulating questions and his occasional use of first- and second-person, will wake up readers accustomed to less in-your-face historical narratives. The book does an excellent job of creating parallels between America&#x2019;s anticommunist efforts and the current fight against terrorism as it questions the price of security and the media&#x2019;s roles in keeping secrets. Period photographs, movie posters, cartoons, and FBI documents supplement a biography abounding in historical context.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>Relying on wide reading and vast research, Aronson paints a nuanced and evenhanded portrait of a man who was complicated, almost certainly neurotic, and who had an iron will to control&#x2013;both himself and others. Thoroughly discussing the FBI&#x2019;s role in law enforcement, the McCarthy witch hunts and HUAC, campaigns against Dr. King and civil rights, and comparing the egregious violations of individual rights and due process committed by the agency to the conduct of post-9/11 containment and treatment of Arab Americans, this book is a must for high school students.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>The biography of an American villain, a history of America during the last century, and a meditation on what it means to be American in the present era&#x2014;Aronson delivers another provocative book.<br>&#x2014;The Horn Book<br><br>This biography is an unflinching portrait of an insecure, scheming zealot who conflated communism, civil rights, and the antiwar movement into a singular, immeasurable menace and dedicated himself to eradicating it... Large black-and-white reproductions of photos, internal memos, and cultural artifacts document a troubled man on a mission... Most compelling is the afterword, wherein the author expresses the challenges and fears he faced exposing the underbelly of the FBI under Hoover, making this both a gripping historical investigation and an instructive example of the researched communication of ideas.<br>&#x2014;Booklist<br><br>Between the photographs and documents, Aronson allows readers to pause and contemplate the viewpoint presented. Even as he seamlessly connects political and social past and present, there is a stunning amount of detail. In the age of multimedia, Aronson dutifully ties in movie titles and Internet sources to supplement specific incidents, constructing a richly researched biography highlighting a tumultuous period of American civil rights.<br>&#x2014;VOYA<br><br>Marc Aronson has written a powerful and thought-provoking book. His devastating, but nuanced portrait of the life and career of J. Edgar Hoover captures the impact of the long-term FBI director on American politics and thought.

Offers basic tips on choosing a vet, dealing with litter box problems, selecting a scratching post, proper grooming and diet, caring for sick cats, and much more. 20 line drawings.</p><p>Frazier, a professional cat groomer and behaviorist, and writer Eckroate here update the manual they first published 10 years ago, because "owners want to know about visualization, Bach flower remedies a form of homeopathy, interspecies communication and all manner of new and expanded home nursing techniques that can be applied to those wonderful cats and those who cherish them." While the authors' views on cat nutrition and tips on how to become a savvy visitor of the veterinarian are persuasive, readers who cherish cats for their inscrutability and independent spirit--or who don't subscribe to what is probably best described as the authors' New Age outlook--will be better off choosing another handbook. Frazier and Eckroate strain both credibility and prose. Since "the human mind is better equipped than the cat's for learning other languages," they suggest that owners make a concerted effort to imagine how their cats feel being left at home for long periods. They urge us to tell ailing pets, "I know how you're feeling . . . (Describe in detail how his body is feeling)." Blinking is recommended as communications tool. Whether truth or foolery, such advice seems likely to inspire a skeptical feline yawn. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This new and revised edition of The Natural Cat ( LJ 6/15/81) covers all aspects of caring for a cat. Drawing on her experience as a nutritionist and groomer to develop her holistic method of raising cats, Frazier advocates natural foods and gives recipes for maximum nutrition. She advises against flea collars and deplores declawing. Her simple cleaning routine solves litter box problems. Anecdotes show how and why her advice is effective, and both owners and cats will benefit from her grooming and handling suggestions.

Karsh spoke of his sitters and his rags-to-riches life, including much that had never before been revealed or recorded. Previously, Karsh had often paired his full-page portraits with stories of his encounters with famous sitters. However, as his oeuvre grew, the photographs soon eclipsed the commentary, and his essays were often edited down to captions.<br><br>Drawing from the newly rediscovered 1988 recordings, Karsh: Beyond the Camera reestablishes the original presentation of Karsh's work, pairing each photograph with the story of its making on the facing page. Published in an affordable small format paperback with flaps, Karsh's portraits are elucidated and complemented both by his own recollections and by the text of veteran curator David Travis. The resulting book, with its chronological rather than thematic arrangement of portraits, is a study of Karsh's artistic and stylistic development, offering the reader an unparalleled tour through the greatest images of the photographer's life work. <br><br>As much as Karsh wrote about his portrait sessions, he rarely revealed what he thought about himself. Travis constructs the compelling history of how a brilliant technician behind the camera was able to go beyond the studio trappings to plumb the psychological realm all great portrait photographers must navigate and master. Although Karsh had a deep understanding of the human psyche, he worked on an emotional level rather than an analytical one. Thus, his stories seldom addressed what he thought about his artistic experiences. This essential element of Karsh's work is what David Travis locates and fills in, drawing not only from the anecdotes themselves, but from the one thing that has been missing from all publications prior to this: the photographer's voice.</p><p>A renowned curator, David Travis has written extensively about modern�ist photography. In 1975, he founded the Department of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago. During a thirty-five-year career, he organized more than 150 exhibitions, which toured museums in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and he has published many foundational texts in the field.Famously reticent about his work, this is a rare invitation to learn the stories behind Karsh&#39;s most famous meetings with great men and women, and of his aesthetic choices when met with the challenge of capturing them as they were. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The Power of Parable: How Fiction by Jesus Became Fiction about Jesus</h2><p>The world&#x2019;s foremost Jesus scholar John Dominic Crossan shows us how the parables present throughout the New Testament not only reveal what Jesus wanted to teach but also provide the key for explaining how the Gospels&#x2019; writers sought to explain the Prophet of Nazareth to the world. In this meaningful exploration of the metaphorical stories told by Jesus and the Gospel writers, Crossan combines the biblical expertise of his <em>The Greatest Prayer </em>with a historical and social analysis that harkens closely to his <em>Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>, creating an illuminating and nuanced exploration of the Scripture that fans of Marcus Borg and Bart Ehrman will find fascinating and essential.<br></p><p><p>In 1969, I was teaching at two seminaries in the Chicago area. One of my courses was on the parables by Jesus and the other was on the resurrection stories about Jesus. I had observed that the parabolic stories by Jesus seemed remarkably similar to the resurrection stories about Jesus. Were the latter intended as parables just as much as the former? Had we been reading parable, presuming history, and misunderstanding both?<br>&#x2014;from <em>The Power of Parable</em></p><p>So begins the quest of renowned Jesus scholar John Dominic Crossan as he unlocks the true meanings and purposes of parable in the Bible so that modern Christians can respond genuinely to Jesus's call to fully participate in the kingdom of God. In <em>The Power of Parable</em>, Crossan examines Jesus's parables and identifies what he calls the "challenge parable" as Jesus's chosen teaching tool for gently urging his followers to probe, question, and debate the ideological absolutes of religious faith and the presuppositions of social, political, and economic traditions.</p><p>Moving from parables <em>by</em> Jesus to parables about Jesus, Crossan then presents the four gospels as "megaparables." By revealing how the gospels are not reflections of the actual biography of Jesus but rather (mis)interpretations by the gospel writers themselves, Crossan reaffirms the power of parables to challenge and enable us to co-create with God a world of justice, love, and peace.</p><p>John Dominic Crossan, professor emeritus at DePaul University, is widely regarded as the foremost historical Jesus scholar of our time. He is the author of several bestselling books, including <em>The Historical Jesus</em>, <em>How to Read the Bible and Still Be a Christian, God and Empire</em>, <em>Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>, <em>The Greatest Prayer, The Last Week, </em>and <em>The Power of Parable</em>.

It is illustrated with the orginal drawings by E.H. Shepard.</p><p>When Christopher Robin asks Pooh what he likes doing best in the world, Pooh says, after much thought, "What I like best in the whole world is Me and Piglet going to see You, and You saying 'What about a little something?' and Me saying, 'Well, I shouldn't mind a little something, should you, Piglet,' and it being a hummy sort of day outside, and birds singing."<p> Happy readers for over 70 years couldn't agree more. Pooh's status as a "Bear of Very Little Brain" belies his profoundly eternal wisdom in the ways of the world. To many, Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and the others are as familiar and important as their own family members. A.A. Milne's classics, <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> and <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>, are brought together in this beautiful edition, complete and unabridged, with recolored illustrations by Milne's creative counterpart, Ernest H. Shepard. Join Pooh and the gang as they meet a Heffalump, help get Pooh unstuck from Rabbit's doorway, (re)build a house for Eeyore, and try to unbounce Tigger. A childhood is simply not complete without full participation in all of Pooh's adventures. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>A.A. Milne grew up in a school - his parents ran Henley House in Kilburn, for young boys - but never intended to be a children&#39;s writer. Pooh he saw as a pleasant sideline to his main career as a playwright and regular scribe for the satirical literary magazine, Punch. Writing was very much the dominant feature of A.A. (Alan Alexander)&#39;s life. He joined the staff of Punch in 1906, and became Assistant Editor. In the course of two decades he fought in the First World War, wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920 (although he described the baby as being more his wife&#39;s work than his own!). Observations of little Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). After that, in spite of enthusiastic demand, Milne declined to write any more children&#39;s stories as he felt that, with his son growing up, they would now only be copies based on a memory. In one way, Christopher Robin turned out to be more famous than his father, though he became uncomfortable with his fame as he got older, preferring to avoid the literary limelight and run a bookshop in Dartmouth. Nevertheless, he published three volumes of his reminiscences before his death in 1996.</p><h2>Gabby: Confessions of a Hockey Lifer</h2><p>Bruce Boudreau is living a hockey Cinderella story.

Currently president of the American Crime Writers League, she lives in Arkansas.Maggody, a little Ozark town where nothing ever happens, has problems. Its first female police chief, Arly Hanks (Malice in Maggody), comes back from vacation to find the community in an uproar: practically everyone is under the influence of psychic Madame Celeste, four hippies have taken over a local store and local prostitute and moonshiner Robin Buchanon has disappeared, leaving behind five hungry children. The mayor's wife, busybody Mrs. Jim Bob Buchanon (the town has a "plethora of Buchanons") wants Arly to do something about the children, a wild and uncivilized lot, but Arly manages to foist them onto Mrs. Jim Bob while she goes hunting for the mother, whom she finds with her head blown off in the middle of a marijuana patch. As she sets out to discover who planted the weed and then booby-trapped it, the children proceed to bring Mrs. Jim Bob low while Madame Celeste has premonitions of disaster. Aided by a possible new love interest, David Allen Wainright, guidance counselor at the local high school, Arly tries to help the children, particularly the foulmouthed but oddly charming Hammet. Another death and the public humiliation of two of the town's most righteous citizens take place before peace comes to Maggody once again. Hess writes an engaging tale, although the raunchy characters impart a certain vulgarity to the text. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dragonlance Chronicles: Dragons of Spring Dawning</h2><p>Penguin edition paperback vg+ condition In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Down with Big Brother: The Fall of the Soviet Empire</h2><p>A unique account of history caught alive, Down with Big Brother recalls Dobbs&#39; days as Washington Post Moscow bureau chief, from 1988 to 1993--during which he was eyewitness to the collapse of the Soviet Union as a world power. 528 pp. Author tour. 25,000 print.</p><p>Ever wonder what it would be like to witness a series of historical turning points?

Bogdanos is devoted to service to his country, competitive boxing, and classic literature, while carrying a healthy disdain for journalists and other intellectuals. His tough-guy demeanor comes across clearly as he details the investigation, efforts to lobby for his mission, and his frustration at the role the media have played in portraying the war and U.S. policy.

But after many months in the wilderness, living in harmony with the wolves that saved her life, she knows the time has come. <p> Julie is not prepared, however, for all the changes that she finds. Her father has forsaken many of the old Eskimo traditions. He has given up his sled dogs for a snowmobile, and now looks after the musk oxen that serve as the village's income. He will do anything to protect them -- even shoot any wolves that might threaten the herd. Julie knows that, like her father, she must find a way to reconcile the old ways with the new. But how can she do that without putting her beloved wolves in danger?</p></p><p>Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in a family of naturalists, Jean George has centered her life around writing and nature. She attended Pennsylvania State University, graduating with degrees in English and science. In the 1940s she was a member of the White House press corps and a reporter for the <i>Washington Post.</i> Ms. George, who has written over 90 books - among them <i>My Side of the Mountain</i> (Dutton), a 1960 Newbery Honor Book, and its sequels <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i> and <i>Frightful's Mountain</i> (both Dutton) - also hikes, canoes, and makes sourdough pancakes. In 1991, Ms. George became the first winner of the School Library Media Section of the New York Library Association's Knickerbocker Award for Juvenile Literature, which was presented to her for the "consistent superior quality" of her literary works.<p>Her inspiration for the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i> evolved from two specific events during a summer she spent studying wolves and tundra at the Arctic Research Laboratory of Barrow, Alaska: "One was a small girl walking the vast ad lonesome tundra outside of Barrow; the other was a magnificent alpha male wolf, leader of a pack in Denali National Park ... They haunted me for a year or more, as did the words of one of the scientists at the lab: 'If there ever was any doubt in my mind that a man could live with the wolves, it is gone now. The wolves are truly gentlemen, highly social and affectionate.'"</p><p>The mother of three children, Jean George is a grandmother who has joyfully red to her grandchildren since they were born. Over the years Jean George has kept 173 pets, not including dogs and cats, in her home in Chappaqua, New York. "Most of these wild animals depart in autumn, when the sun changes their behavior and they feel the urge to migrate or go off alone. While they are with us, however, they become characters in my books, articles, and stories."</p>Grade 5-8-George continues the story begun in Newbery-award winning Julie of the Wolves (HarperCollins, 1974) with the young woman's return to her father's home in Kangik, Alaska. As she becomes reaquainted with Kapugen, she tries to accept the fact that he killed her beloved wolf Amaroq. She must also come to terms with her father's abandonment of some traditional Eskimo ways in order to help the local population survive, his new wife (a white woman), and a new romantic interest of her own. Julie is no longer a loner; she, too, learns about being a part of a community, one that is struggling to exist in a difficult and changing environment. But she also vows to protect the surviving wolves and move them to a place where they will not threaten her father's herd of musk-oxen. Although there is purpose (nearing obsession) to Julie's actions, readers must pay attention to the frequent shifts in the location of the wolf pack and the all-important caribou, vital to both the survival of the wolves and the village. As Julie seeks to move the pack leader, Kapu, and the other wolves closer to a food source, readers may sense some resemblance to the scenes of gaining trust in the earlier title and some may question Julie's interference with the natural order of things (an intervention she cannot possibly maintain). Still, the sense of place and of a people is strong throughout. In the end, her father changes his philosophy from needing to kill the wolves to releasing his oxen into the wild, a conclusion that is a bit abrupt but thoroughly satisfying.<br><i>Susan Knorr, Milwaukee Public Library, WI</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Recollections of Death: A Medical Investigation</h2><p>Will ship immediately.

Their friendship flourished for forty years through correspondence and visits to the capitals where her husband, the diplomat B. K. Nehru, was posted. Then, at her ninetieth birthday celebration in 1998, Auntie Fori told her &#x201c;adopted nephew&#x201d; that she was not of Indian birth but was actually Hungarian&#x2013;and Jewish. She did not know what this Jewish identity involved&#x2013;historically or spiritually&#x2013;and she asked him to enlighten her.<br><br>In response, Sir Martin embarked on the series of letters that have been gathered to form this book, shaping each one as a concise, individually formed story. He presents Jewish history as the narrative expression&#x2013;the timeline&#x2013;of the Jewish faith, and the faith as it is informed by the history. Starting with Adam and Eve, he then brings us to Abraham and his descendants, who worshiped a God who repeatedly, and often dramatically, intervened in their lives. The stories of Genesis and Exodus lead seamlessly on to those of the eras when the land was ruled by the Israelite kings and then by Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome&#x2013;the Biblical and post-Biblical periods. In Sir Martin&#x2019;s hands, these stories are rich in incident and achievement. He then traces the long history of the Jews in the Diaspora, ending with an unexpected visit to an outpost of Jewry in Anchorage, Alaska. Ranging through almost every country in the world&#x2013;including China and India&#x2013;he maintains a chronological structure, weaving in the history of other peoples and faiths, to give Auntie Fori&#x2013;and us&#x2013;a sense of the larger stage on which Jewish history has played out.<br><br>The last fifty letters are devoted to an explanation of Jewish faith and worship, intertwined with the history and observance of holy days and festivals. <br><br>These letters are fascinating in their objectivity and at the same time infused with a deep personal warmth. <br><br>Written for one beloved friend, <i>Letters to Auntie Fori</i> brings to life the events and sequence of Jewish history with a special charm that will endear this volume to readers old and young.</p><p>Martin Gilbert's <i>Letters to Auntie Fori</i> is a proud, 140-part epistolary history of the Jews as well as a parsing of the basic tenets of the faith and the meaning and form of its holy days and ritual observances. Beginning with the first chapter of Genesis, Gilbert follows his people through five millennia, concluding with the founding of Israel and, briefly, the political and religious Middle-Eastern turmoil of the present day. Especially interesting are his chapters on the Diaspora, as well as brief summaries of Jewish heroes in World War I, the dark horrors of World War II, and short recitals of Jewish luminaries in industry, politics, sports, and the arts and sciences. Though Gilbert is hardly a disinterested narrator, his erudite informality (the recipient of his letter-chapters is a well-educated and elderly friend effectively innocent of any knowledge of Judaism) serves his complex subject admirably. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>Sir Martin Gilbert is one of the foremost historians of our time. The official biographer of Winston Churchill, he is also the author of a definitive history of the Holocaust, twelve historical atlases, comprehensive studies of both the First and Second World Wars, and <i>The Jews in the Twentieth Century: An Illustrated History</i>.

Tour.</p><p>McAuliffe, an editor for the Washington Post, offers an informative, often poignant story of a suppressed chapter of American history--a kind of Native American Roots. Sybil Bolton, the author's maternal grandmother, died many deaths--or so it seems. Did she die of complications from diabetes, as McAuliffe was first told? Did she succumb to kidney disease, as his mother later claimed? Did she commit suicide, as the death certificate attests? Or was she murdered while holding her infant daughter in her arms? McAuliffe, who was not told of his Indian heritage until he was 15, sets out to find the answer. The title of his book not only reflects the varied accounts of her demise but also seeks to universalize her story, as the author uncovers an unsavory corner of the American Dream. Bolton was an Osage Indian, a tribe that became unimaginably rich during the first part of this century after oil was discovered on their Oklahoma land. Whites, who had previously taken little notice of it, sought to secure the land by purchase, swindle, subterfuge, and even murder: In what became known as the Osage Reign of Terror, 1%3% of the tribe were killed within a short period of time. Virtually all these deaths were swept under the rug and never investigated. Journeying to Pawhuska, Okla., center of the old Osage reservation, the author becomes convinced that Bolton was indeed murdered, probably by her mother's husband, in an attempt to get her oil royalties. As he searches for clues to a homicide, he gets in touch with his Indian past and comes to know himself better. It's all very intriguing and reads like a murder mystery, but the book is flawed by McAuliffe's essentializing of Indians. His attribution of his alcoholism to his Indianness, for instance, comes perilously close to racism. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>By the time journalist McAuliffe completed tracing his own Native American roots, he had also solved a dormant 60-year-old murder mystery via a painstaking familial and historical investigation. When the author initially embarked upon his highly personal odyssey into the past, he discovered the shocking fact that his maternal grandmother, Sybil Bolton, a beautiful, well-educated member of the oil-rich Osage tribe, had apparently committed suicide at the tender age of 22. While reconstructing the shattered pieces of his grandmother's brief life, McAuliffe began to suspect foul play. By interweaving Sybil's heartbreaking story with the tragic chronicle of the Osage nation, he arrived at the well-founded conclusion that she, like hundreds of other wealthy Osages during the 1920s, fell victim to the white lawyer assigned to act on her behalf by the U.S. government. An intimate quest for identity, a fascinating real-life whodunit, and a shattering expos{&#x201a;}e of another shameful episode in the painful history of U.S. and Indian relations. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i></p><h2>Tarzan&#39;s Quest (Tarzan Series #19)</h2><p>Tarzan of the Apes had heard only rumors of the Kavuru--a race of strange white savages.

In <i>Infinite Life</i> he invites readers into a fascinating new way of thinking, living, and meditating that might do more to save the world than any political act known to humans. In recognizing that our lives and even our moment-to-moment choices have eternal ramifications, we are at once free from the burden of petty pursuits yet suddenly saddled with the weight of infinite responsibility. Thurman helps students understand that carrying this weight is the only way we can free ourselves and the rest of the world form suffering. Buddhists recognize this as the path of "the bodhisattva," dedicated to the well-being of all beings. In order to help readers make this quantum shift in awareness, Thurman structures his chapters around the <i>paramitas</i>, or transcendent virtues: wisdom, generosity, patience, contemplation, justice (usually called "discipline"), and creativity ("diligence"). He adds a seventh virtue: art&#x2014;as in the "art of infinite living." Each chapter includes a lesson on a virtue as well as meditations and life choices that support personal and global transformation. <p></p> "You can try out a whole new approach to life," he promises. "Then we'll explore how can put your new ideas into practice in the world, turning your thoughts into action. We'll examine the repercussions of your personal change on society and on the fragile, opalescent planet. We'll see how personal transformation is social transformation."<p></p><p> He delivers his promise with political and spiritual punch. Some criticize Thurman for his outspokenness against the current Bush administration. But for those who want to use their spirituality to create political change&#x2014;this book is filled with excellent meditations and lifestyle suggestions for bringing about global compassion and humanity. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>Robert Thurman holds the first endowed chair in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies in America at Columbia University.</p><h2>Each Man In His Time</h2><p>This is a funny book by a director working in the early days of Hollywood.

The same morning&#x2014;the first of a new Muslim century&#x2014;hundreds of gunmen stunned the world by seizing Islam&#x2019;s holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Armed with rifles that they had smuggled inside coffins, these men came from more than a dozen countries, launching the first operation of global jihad in modern times. Led by a Saudi preacher named Juhayman al Uteybi, they believed that the Saudi royal family had become a craven servant of American infidels, and sought a return to the glory of uncompromising Islam. With nearly 100,000 worshippers trapped inside the holy compound, Mecca&#x2019;s bloody siege lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths.<br><br>Despite U.S. assistance, the Saudi royal family proved haplessly incapable of dislodging the occupier, whose ranks included American converts to Islam. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini blamed the Great Satan&#x2014;the United States &#x2014;for defiling the shrine, prompting mobs to storm and torch American embassies in Pakistan and Libya. The desperate Saudis finally enlisted the help of French commandos led by tough-as-nails Captain Paul Barril, who prepared the final assault and supplied poison gas that knocked out the insurgents. Though most captured gunmen were quickly beheaded, the Saudi royal family responded to this unprecedented challenge by compromising with the rebels&#x2019; supporters among the kingdom&#x2019;s most senior clerics, helping them nurture and export Juhayman&#x2019;s violent brand of Islam around the world. <br><br>This dramatic and immensely consequential story was barely covered in the press in the pre-CNN, pre&#x2013;Al Jazeera days, as Saudi Arabia imposed an information blackout and kept foreign correspondents away. Yaroslav Trofimov now penetrates this veil of silence, interviewing for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, including former terrorists, and drawing on hundreds of documents that had been declassified on his request. Written with the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, <i>The Siege of Mecca</i> reveals how Saudi reaction to the uprising in Mecca set free the forces that produced the attacks of 9/11, and the harrowing circumstances that surround us today.</p></p><p><p>YAROSLAV TROFIMOV, a staff foreign correspondent of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> since 1999, has extensively reported from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries. He is also the author of <i>Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu.</i></p><b>INTRODUCTION<br></b><br>The holy city of Mecca looked deceptively calm as the first dawn of the new century started to break behind craggy mountains.<br><br>Splashing his face with cold water, the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s bearded imam fastened a beige-hued cloak over his shoulders and muttered praises to the Lord. The time to lead the morning&#x2019;s first prayer was minutes away.<br><br>Under his window, the mosque&#x2019;s floodlit courtyard was filling up quickly. The hajj pilgrimage season, when this stadium-size enclosure was traversed by more than a million worshippers, had already ended. Yet Mecca remained jam-packed with the faithful. Many of them had spent the night inside Islam&#x2019;s holiest shrine, curling up on wool carpets in the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s multistory labyrinth of nearly a thousand rooms.<br><br>As usual, these worshippers camped along with their bundles, mattresses, and suitcases that nobody had bothered to check. Following custom, many hauled in wooden coffins, hoping that the imam would bestow on decomposing relatives inside the precious blessings that can only be received in such a sacred precinct.<br><br>Today, some of these coffins contained an unusual cargo: Kalashnikov assault rifles, Belgian-made FN-FAL guns, bullet belts, and an assortment of pistols.<br><br>The men who had smuggled this arsenal into the mosque sought an ambitious goal: to reverse the flow of world history, sparking a global war that would finally lead to Islam&#x2019;s total victory and to a destruction of arrogant Christians and Jews.<br>The date was the First of Muharram of Islam&#x2019;s year 1400&#x2013;which in calendars kept by infidel Westerners corresponded to November 20, 1979.<br><br>For the natives of Mecca, a city that lives off the flood of humanity that has coursed through its shrines since time immemorial, this Tuesday morning promised a particularly joyful occasion: New Year&#x2019;s day is when, according to tradition, the Meccans make a pilgrimage of their own to the Grand Mosque.<br><br>In darkness, thousands trekked to the outskirts of the city, shedding everyday clothes after a shower and returning in the pilgrims&#x2019; snow white <i>ihram </i>outfits&#x2013;two towel-like garments that symbolize purity and leave men&#x2019;s right shoulders exposed.<br><br>Mixing in with the locals were as many as 100,000 visitors from all over the world&#x2013;Pakistanis and Indonesians, Moroccans and Yemenis, Nigerians and Turks. Some were stragglers left behind after the hajj, entrepreneurial pilgrims who, year after year, try to offset the cost of their passage by reselling in Mecca&#x2019;s bazaars exotic wares from their remote homelands. Others had arrived in Mecca just to witness the turn of the<br>century&#x2013;a once-in-a-lifetime event. <br><br>Hidden in this human sea were hundreds of grim-faced rebels, many of them sporting red checkered headdresses. Some had been inside the mosque for days, reconnoitering its maze of corridors and passageways. Others were bused in during the night by a friendly religious academy. Yet others drove their own cars to Mecca this morning, arriving at the last minute and accompanied by children and wives to allay guards&#x2019; suspicions.<br><br>Most of these conspirators were Saudis of Bedouin stock, though their ranks also brimmed with foreigners, if such a word had a meaning for men who believed in the single citizenship of Islam. They even included African American converts, inspired by a new faith and hardened by race riots half a world away.<br><br>The color of the cloudless sky just started to turn from grayish to pink when the dawn ritual began, as it does that time of the year, at 5:18 a.m. <i>&#x201c;La ilaha ila Allah,&#x201d; </i>the deep-voiced prayer call rang from new loudspeakers affixed atop the mosque&#x2019;s seven towering minarets: &#x201c;There is no god but Allah.&#x201d;<br><br>Barefoot, worshippers knelt in the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s marble-paved courtyard. Clearing his throat, the imam picked up the microphone and read out the blessings. On his cue, the faithful prostrated themselves on the ground, in a vast succession of concentric circles that radiated from the Kaaba, an ancient cube draped in black silk embroidered with gold<br>that looms in the center of the enclosure.<br><br>Then, just as the imam concluded the prayer with wishes of peace, gunshots rang out. The crackling sound reverberated in the courtyard as in an echo chamber. Stunned worshippers spotted a young man, a rifle in his hands, walking briskly toward the Kaaba. Another shot sent into the air flocks of panicked pigeons that usually graze on the plaza<br>outside the Grand Mosque.<br><br>Rumors quickly swirled through the crowd. What could all this be? What was all that noise? Maybe there is an innocuous explanation, one man opined. Maybe the gunmen were bodyguards for some senior prince, or even the Saudi monarch, King Khaled, himself ? Maybe the gunfire was just some peculiar Saudi way to celebrate the New Year?<br><br>More knowledgeable worshippers shuddered. Firing a weapon in the Grand Mosque, they knew, was a grave sin. They couldn&#x2019;t recall the last time such a sacrilege had occurred. Pilgrims watched with angst as more and more gunmen closed in on the Kaaba, carrying weapons that had been extracted from uncrated coffins. The Grand Mosque&#x2019;s own police force, armed with nothing more threatening than sticks for beating misbehaving foreign pilgrims, melted away once two guards who attempted resistance fell dead by the gates.<br>Amid this commotion, the rebels&#x2019; leader, Juhayman al Uteybi, emerged from the depths of the mosque. A forty-three-year-old Bedouin preacher with magnetic black eyes, sensual lips, and shoulder-length hair that seamlessly blended into a black curly beard, Juhayman conveyed a sense of immediate authority despite his slender stature. Emulating a piety first displayed by Prophet Mohammed himself, he wore a traditional Saudi white robe that was cut short at midcalf to signal the rejection of material goods. Unlike his fellow gunmen, he was bareheaded, with only a thin green hair band keeping his unruly locks in check.<br><br>Flanked by three militants armed with rifles, pistols, and daggers, Juhayman started to elbow his way across the courtyard, toward the sacred Kaaba and the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s imam. The cleric, who had just turned his face away from the Kaaba and toward the distressing tumult among the believers, noticed that he was standing right next to a coffin.<br>This one contained a real cadaver; the dead child&#x2019;s relatives, oblivious to the mounting upheaval, were imploring the imam to bless the tiny corpse.<br><br>As the cleric obliged, reciting the sacred lines, recognition flickered on his face. He realized in these moments that Juhayman and some of the other gunmen, who now got disconcertingly close, had attended his lectures on Islam here in Mecca. This feeling turned to horror seconds later, as Juhayman unceremoniously pushed the cleric aside and seized the microphone. When the imam tried to wrestle back the mike, one of the intruders raised a sharp curved dagger and screamed at the top of his lungs, ready to stab.<br><br>A fright swept the crowd.<br><br>Picking up shoes, thousands rushed toward the enclosure&#x2019;s gates, only to find all fifty-one of them chained shut. Ragged-looking gun- men, muzzles staring into the crowd, barred all exits. Unsure of how to behave, some worshippers started chanting <i>&#x201c;Allahu Akbar&#x201d;&#x2013;</i>&#x201c;God is Greatest&#x201d;&#x2013;the Muslims&#x2019; invocation of faith in a moment of adversity. The gunmen unexpectedly joined in this chorus and it became louder and louder, spreading throughout the packed mosque until it turned into a deafening roar.<br><br>When this chanting subsided, Juhayman barked into the microphone a series of clipped military commands. Following his instructions, scores of his well-trained followers dispersed throughout the compound, setting up machine-gun nests atop the shrine&#x2019;s seven minarets. Trapped pilgrims were gang-pressed into aiding the rebels. Some had to roll up the thousands of heavy carpets inside the courtyard and prop them up against the chained<br>gates. The fittest were forced at gunpoint to climb the steep staircases to the tops of the minarets, carrying water and crates of ammunition. The takeover of Islam&#x2019;s holy of holies was swift and complete.<br><br>At their 89 meters (292 feet) of height, the mosque&#x2019;s minarets overlooked much of downtown Mecca, providing rebel snipers with a vast field of fire. Trigger fingers caressing the cold metal, they scanned neighboring streets for potential foes. &#x201c;If you see a government soldier who wants to raise his hand against you, have no pity and shoot him because he wants to kill you,&#x201d; Juhayman instructed these snipers in his guttural desert accent. &#x201c;Do not hesitate!&#x201d;<br>Under the minarets, even Saudis&#x2013;proficient in the local dialect&#x2013;had a hard time understanding what was going on. The crying of women, the coughing of elders, and the shuffling of bare feet filled the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s courtyard with an anxious hum. Many foreigners among the tens of thousands of hostages spoke no Arabic at all and stood transfixed in the turmoil, asking better-educated countrymen for explanation in a multitude of tongues.<br><br>The conspirators were prepared for linguistic problems, and wanted to be comprehended. Soon they grouped Pakistani and Indian pilgrims on one side of the mosque, with a Pakistani-born rebel interpreting the announcements in Urdu to bewildered compatriots. A cluster of Africans was provided with a speaker of English. &#x201c;Sit down, sit down and listen,&#x201d; Juhayman&#x2019;s gunmen yelled, rifle-butting those pilgrims who dared to disobey.<br><br>As cowed worshippers finally settled in fearful attention, the mysterious group indicated that its authority now extended well beyond the Grand Mosque to Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s commercial capital and to the second of the country&#x2019;s two holy cities. &#x201c;Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah are now in our hands...</p><h2>Desire of Ages, Large-Print Gift Ed.</h2><p>The complete text in large, readable type<br> Now the full text version of The Desire of Ages can be yours in this easy-to-read, large print edition.

As well as the innovative, striking design of the book, the appeal also lies in the exquisite simplicity of its food. A sophisticated re-interpretation of the cucina rustica or farmhouse cooking of northern Italy, the food of the River Cafe relies on good quality, fresh, seasonal produce. Ruth and Rose's direct, uncomplicated approach means that many of the dishes are strikingly simple - fish, meat and vegetables are chargrilled, pan-fried and baked - but all of them are vibrant with flavour. This cookbook retains the essential style of the River Cafe while reflecting the new directions Ruth and Rose's cooking took since their first book; meat is less prominent, for example, while vegetables and vegetarian food have become more important; techniques, such as wood-roasting are featured, always with advice on how the results can be achieved in a domestic oven. With over 200 new recipes, <i>River Cafe Cook Book 2</i> is a must both for the many people who loved the first volume and for those who have yet to discover the delights of the River Cafe's unique style of Italian cooking. <i>from Goodreads</i></p></p><p></p><h2>The Giving Quilt (Elm Creek Quilts: Thorndike Press Large Print Core)</h2><p>When the creative residents of Elm Creek gather the week after Thanksgiving to work on quilts for Project Linus, they respond to Sylvia&#39;s provocative questions to alleviate respective personal challenges and learn helpful lessons about the strength of human connections.

Published to accompany a major exhibition that opened at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in early 1996.</p><p>That DeCarava was a painter and graphic artist before turning to photography does much to explain the strong lines, extraordinarily rich tonality, and dramatic exploitation of light in his photos. Their emotional charge, however, arises from the social choices DeCarava made for his career. He has expended nearly his entire professional effort upon New York City's black communities. He cherishes the people, places, and events in his pictures and developed early the means to express his affection. He shoots using only ambient light, then prints so as to coax light expressively out of very dark images or, less often, to delineate darker detail in very light ones. The grays in his black-and-white pictures are velvety and warm--qualities he occasionally enhances by purposely shooting out of focus or exposing long enough to show movement. Whether a picture's immediate subject is documentarily realistic or, as in a photo such as <i>Crushed Can</i>, an abstract form bodied forth in a concrete object, the work is charged with earthy mystery, like a prime Rembrandt painting or a late Michelangelo sculpture in which, because of the artist's rendering of light and mass, life seems to be springing off the canvas, out of the stone, like Adam from the earth on the day of his creation. Like one of his favorite portrait subjects, John Coltrane, DeCarava is one of the transcendently great American artists. <i>Ray Olson</i>This survey of a half-century of photographer Roy DeCarava's (b. 1919) drawings, serigraphs, and photographs accompanies a traveling exhibition. DeCarava, the first African American to win a Guggenheim Fellowship (in 1952), illustrated Langston Hughes's The Sweet Flypaper of Life (1955), yet the only previous monograph on his work is out of print. Here, his wife, art historian Sherry Turner DeCarava, provides a perceptive essay about his early life, his first drawings and serigraphs, and the emergence of his expressive, unsentimental, and sometimes abstract photographic style, which makes his work immediately recognizable. Galassi, chief curator of photography for the Museum of Modern Art, surveys DeCarava's career and influences and provides new information on one of the earliest photographic galleries in New York City, A Photographer's Gallery, opened by the DeCaravas in their home. The quality of the works reproduced here, which often focus on black life in New York City, is superb.

Vianne, with her daughters, Anouk and Rosette, finds Lansquenet changed in unexpected ways: women veiled in black, the scent of spices and peppermint tea&#x2014;and there, on the bank of the river Tannes, facing the church, a minaret. Most surprising of all, her old nemesis, Father Francis Reynaud, desperately needs her help.Can Vianne work her magic once again?</p><p><b>Joanne Harris</b> is the author of the Whitbread Award-nominated <i>Chocolat</i> (made into an Oscar-nominated film starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp) and eleven other bestselling novels.

With charm and allure, the novel explores the difference one person can make. For all Vianne&#x2019;s magic, the recipe for success is simply uncovering what keeps people apart and what binds them together. --Bridget Thoreson</p><h2>Transforming Therapy: A New Approach to Hypnotherapy</h2><p>The Offficial Training Manual: history, techniques, actual case histories.

Hundreds of thousands of pieces of art and whole libraries were removed in chaotic circumstances, only to disappear into the gulag of Stalinist cultural policy. The very existence of such loot was denied until well into the 1990s. In what could be considered the sequel to Lynn Nicholas's Rape of Europa (LJ 5/1/94), which dealt with Nazi art pillage, a group of Russian art historians and museum workers have pieced together the rough outlines of how this happened, interviewing many of the minor players in the process. Their narrative, while disjointed, therefore has some personal immediacy as recent official acknowledgment of Russian actions and continued contests over ownership and restitution have been made public. There is a beginning and a middle, but no end yet; for all its unevenness and episodic quality, this is still an engrossing tale. Recommended for general collections.

As heavy as they were, my thoughts were heavier and even more deadly. I was trying to move murder off my mind.<br><br><i>Kidnapping </i>is a bullshit English word. It doesn&#x2019;t convey the insult that the offense carries, when a man invades another man&#x2019;s home, fucks with his family or his wife, <i>la kadar Allah </i>(God forbid), and steals her away.<br><br>The man whose wife is gone stands there try&#x2019;na push the puzzle pieces together of where his wife is exactly and what happened exactly. His blood begins to boil, thicken, curdle, and even starts to choke him. That&#x2019;s why for me, kidnapping and murder go hand in hand.<br><br>In my case, my young wife Akemi&#x2019;s kidnapper is her own father, her closest blood relation, a man who she loves and honors. For me to kill him would be to lose her even if I win her back. And I refuse to lose.<br><br><i>Ekhtetaf </i>is our word for kidnapping. My Umma pushed it out from her pretty lips. She pulled it from her soul and gave it the true feeling that it carried for us&#x2014;the hurt, shame, violation, and insult. For half a day it was all that she said after I relayed to her that Akemi was gone. My new wife had been taken against her will back to Japan without a chance to express herself to us, her new family, face to face.<br><br>For me to see my mother Umma&#x2019;s Sudanese eyes filled with tears tripled my trauma. I had dedicated my young life to keeping the water out of my mother&#x2019;s eyes and returning a measure of joy to her heart that life had somehow stolen. But Sunday night, when our home phone finally rang, and Umma answered only to hear the silence of Akemi&#x2019;s voice and the gasp in Akemi&#x2019;s breathing and the restraint in Akemi&#x2019;s crying, Umma&#x2019;s tears did fall.<br><br>There was a furious rainstorm that same Sunday. Everything was soaked, the afternoon sky had blackened and then bled at sunset. So did Umma&#x2019;s eyes switch from sunlight to sadness to rain and eventually redness.<br><br>Through the evening thunder I sat still trying to simmer. They say there is a beast within every man, and I was taming my beast with music. My earplugs were siphoning the sounds of Art of Noise, a soothing song called &#x201c;Moments of Love.&#x201d;<br><br>My sister Naja held her head low. She was responding to our mother Umma&#x2019;s feelings. Like the eight-year-old that she is, she did not grasp the seriousness of Akemi&#x2019;s disappearance and believed more than Umma and I that Akemi would be coming through the door at any moment.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Much later that same Sunday night, family day for us, my Umma placed a purple candle in a maroon dish and onto her bedroom floor. She struck a black-tipped match and it blazed up blue. The subtle scent of lavender released into her air. There in the darkness, I sat on her floor, leaning against the wall, and listened to her melodic African voice in the expressive Arabic language, as she told me for the first time ever the story, or should I say saga, of my father&#x2019;s fight to take <i>her </i>as his first bride, true love, and true heart. I knew then that the darkness in her room was intentional. She wanted to shield the sea of her emotions since there was no love more intense than the mutual love between her and my father. She also wanted to subdue my fury.<br>She wanted me to concentrate instead on the red and then orange and then blue flame and listen intently for the meaning of her words and the moral of her story so that I would know why I must not fail to bring Akemi back home and why I had to seize victory, the same as my father did.<br><br><b><i>Monday, May 5th, 1986</i></b><br><br>At daybreak, when the moon became the sun, Umma&#x2019;s story was completed. She lay gently on the floor still dressed in her fuschia <i>thobe</i>. Her hair spread across her arm as she slipped into sleep. Our lives and even our day were both upside down now. I lifted her and placed her onto her bed. I put out the flame that danced on the plate in the middle of mostly melted wax. <br><br>Umma was supposed to be preparing for work, but her most important job, which took all night, was finally finished. She wanted to transfer my father&#x2019;s strength and intelligence and brave heart to me, her son. She wanted me to know that I must not be halted by my deep love for her, my mother. She had told me, &#x201c;You have guarded my life and built our family business. I love you more than you could ever imagine. In my prayers, I thank Allah every day for creating your soul and giving you life. I thank Allah for choosing to send you through my body. But now, &#x2018;<i>You must follow the trail of your seed.</i>&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br><b>Chapter 2</b><br><b>So in Love</b><br><br>Naja overslept. When I went into her room to wake her for school I found her sleeping in her same clothes from yesterday and clutching a doll. The scene was strange. At night she usually wore her pajamas and her robe and woke up wearing them as well. She didn&#x2019;t play with dolls, wasn&#x2019;t the type, was more into puzzles and pets. As I approached her bed, I saw the doll had the same hair as my wife, long, black, and thick. <i>That hair is real, </i>I thought to myself, and reached for the doll. I maneuvered it out of Naja&#x2019;s hands and flipped it around. It was a tan-skinned doll with Japanese eyes drawn on with a heavy permanent black Sharpie marker. The material was sewn and held together with a rough and amateurish stitch.<br><br>Naja woke up and said with a sleepy slur and stutter, &#x201c;I finally made something by myself.&#x201d; She turned sideways in her bed, propping her head up with her hand, and said now with confidence, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Akemi. Can&#x2019;t you tell?&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled the way a man with troubles on his mind might smile to protect a child&#x2019;s innocent view of the world. I could&#x2019;ve easily got tight with my little sister because she had gone into my room and removed the ponytail of hair that Akemi had chopped off of her own head one day in frustration with her Japanese family.<br><br>&#x201c;It looks like her. You did a good job,&#x201d; I told Naja.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you really think it looks like your wife or are you just saying that to be nice?&#x201d; Naja asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying it to be nice. Now get up, you&#x2019;re running late for school today.&#x201d;<br><br>* * *<br><br>Akemi&#x2019;s expensive collection of high heels was lined up against the wall in our bedroom. Her hand-painted Nikes and other kicks with colorful laces were spread out too. Her luggage and clothing, every dress and each skirt a memory of something sweet, were all there. Her black eyeliner pencil that outlined her already dark and beautiful eyes was left out on the desktop. The perfume elixir that Umma made for Akemi, but truly for my pleasure, was there also. The crystal bottle top was tilted to the right from the last use. Her yoga mat was rolled up and lying in the corner. She had left her diary out for all to see. She knew we could not read one word of the Japanese kanji that began on the last page and ended on the first. Yet she had colorful drawings in there as well. Just then I recalled her fingers gliding down the page with a colored pencil in one hand and a chunk of charcoal in the other.<br><br>Everywhere in our bedroom there were signs that this was a woman, a wife who lived here beside me, her husband, and definitely intended to stay. We are teenagers, Akemi and I, but we are both sure of our bond. Furthermore, we took that bold and irreversible step into marriage and our two hearts became one.<br><br>She had left her designer life and luxurious apartment behind and moved into the Brooklyn projects to be beside and beneath me. So in love, even in the chaos of this hood, and the glare of the ambulances and scream of sirens, she could only see me. Each day her love became more sweeter, her smile even brighter.<br><br>After hearing Umma&#x2019;s story, I understood now that in the Sudan, my home country, the kidnapping of females is unusual but has happened, especially when two men were battling over the same woman. A Sudanese man will fight hard and by any means necessary to earn the right and advantage over the next man to marry the bride of his choice and make her his own.<br><br>Yet our men never battle over a woman after the marriage has already taken place, been witnessed, acknowledged, and agreed on. We never battle to win a woman after her husband has gone into her. And I had gone into my wife Akemi over and over and in so many ways that the thought alone made my heart begin to race and my entire body began to sweat like summer, but in the spring season.<br><br>I looked at my bedsheets that I had never thought about before. Umma had selected those sheets knowing that a man wouldn&#x2019;t mind but a woman would. She dressed up my bed one day while I was out. Umma wanted Akemi to feel good and welcomed. I had to admit that those Egyptian cotton sheets were soft and comfortable. Only Akemi&#x2019;s skin was softer.<br><br><i>Eateda </i>is the word from back home that describes for us a bigger offense.<br><br>My mind switched to that thought. <i>Eateda </i>happens when a kidnapper steals a woman against her will, then rapes her. I promised myself that in my blood relation beef with my wife&#x2019;s father, this was not that type of problem. Yet I also knew that when a man is not beside his woman, protecting, loving, providing, and influencing her all the time, <i>eateda </i>is always possible by any man who is allowed to be in the same room with her, if that man is living low.<br><br>* * *<br><br>My sensei taught me the technique of breathing a certain way to lower the blood pressure and calm the mind and settle the heart. It was not a technique meant to prevent a murder. A man has to think but not too much. Thinking to an extreme can paralyze a man&#x2019;s actions and turn him into a passive coward. What Sensei taught me was a technique meant mainly to calm a warrior to prepare him to make the sharpest, wisest, most effective strike against his target. So I was using it as I stepped swiftly down the subway stairs and out of the spring air. Now it was Monday. My feet were moving rhythmically with my breathing. My game face was neutral, but my soul was scowling. Each time that I cleared my murderous thoughts, they would reappear.</p><h2>No Graves as Yet: A Novel of World War I, 1st Edition</h2><p>Through Anne Perry&#x2019;s magnificent Victorian novels, millions of readers have enjoyed the pleasures and intrigue of a bygone age.

For this and the other myriad rudeness that nowadays pass for consolation, congratulation and other forms of verbal communication, Miss Manners provides politely pointed comebacks, as well as the gracious and proper thing to say in any situation.<br><br>Miss Manners feels compelled to do so because saying the wrong thing -- whether in the name of originality, self-expression, honesty or instant empathy -- has become all too common:<br><br>To a Bereaved Person:<br><i>"You must realize it's all for the best."</i><br><br>To a Newly Engaged Person:<br><i>"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"</i><br><br>To a Pregnant Woman:<br><i>"You can still do something about it, you know."</i><br><br><b>The Right Thing to Say</b> is a refresher course in etiquette as a second language, filled with the practical advice and sly humor that make Miss Manners such "good wicked fun, and helpful too" (<i>Cosmopolitan</i>). Including useful phrases for dealing with life's special occasions and mishaps, <b>The Right Thing to Say</b> explores the subtleties of saying "no," conducting a conversation without causing offense and the art of the apology when you do anyway.</p><p><b>Judith Martin</b> is the author of numerous books, including the best-selling <b>Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior</b>. Her thrice-weekly syndicated column appears in more than two hundred North American newspapers. She lives in Washington D.C.The conceit of "basic training" --Martin has previously put out books on eating and electronic communication under that boot-camp heading--indicates how far she believes manners have fallen. The culpable trend in conversational manners, her topic here, is the tendency for the etiquette-challenged to emote, to be honest, to be original. Where once one answered the pleasantry, "How are you?" with, "Fine, thank-you," modern custom threatens the inquirer with a soul-baring soliloquy on the interrogatee's exact state of mind. Miss Manners deplores this. She prefers euphemism and conventional phrases, and in this, as in her previous books, she issues rulings in response to letters she receives. The gaffes and embarrassments her correspondents record are entirely avoidable, Miss Manners assures them, if only they would keep a few rules in mind: say every baby is beautiful, confine commiseration to an "I'm so sorry," say no nicely, and don't talk about politics, religion, and grandmother's failing health. Like an interpreter in a foreign country, she even provides the phrase book, in the form of boldface replies to conceal the bold-faced lies that we need in order to extricate ourselves from potential crises. To a friend who is marrying an unsuitable partner, "Congratulations," not "Don't do it!" is the right thing to say. Martin is an amusingly sardonic arbiter, and her manual should be popular. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Dianetics: The Original Thesis</h2><p><p>Here is Ron&#x2019;s first description of Dianetics.

In testament to the first stands the full body of his life&#x2019;s work, including some 12,000 writings and 3,000 tape-recorded lectures of Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; &nbsp;In evidence of the second are the hundreds of millions of individuals whose lives have been demonstrably bettered because he lived. They are the more than 28 million students now reading superlatively owing to L. Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s educational discoveries; they are the millions of men and women freed from substance abuse through L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s breakthroughs in drug rehabilitation; they are the near 100 million who have been touched by his nonreligious moral code: and they are the many millions more who hold his work to be the spiritual cornerstone of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Although best known for Dianetics and Scientology, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard cannot be so simply categorized. If nothing else, his life was too varied, his influence too broad. There are tribesmen in Southern Africa, for example, who know nothing of Dianetics and Scientology, but they know L. Ron Hubbard the educator.&nbsp; Likewise, there are factory workers in Albania who know him only for his administrative discoveries; children in China who know him only as the author of their moral code, and readers in dozens of languages who know him only for his novels. So, no, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is not an easy man to categorize and certainly does not fit popular misconceptions of &#x201c;religious founder&#x201d; as an aloof and contemplative figure. Yet the more one comes to know this man and his achievements, the more one comes to realize he was precisely the sort of person to have brought us Scientology, the only major religion to have been founded in the twentieth century.&nbsp;</p><p>What Scientology offers is likewise what one would expect of a man such as&nbsp; L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard. For not only does it provide a fully unique approach to our most fundamental questions&#x2014;Who are we? From where did we come and what is our destiny? But it further provides an equally unique technology for greater spiritual awareness. So how would we expect to characterize the founder of such a religion? Clearly, he would have to be larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields&#x2014;all exactly L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is, if Mr. Hubbard had stopped after only one of his many accomplishments he would still be celebrated today. For example, with 46 million works of fiction in circulation, including such monumental bestsellers as Battlefield Earth, Fear and the Mission Earth series, Mr. Hubbard is unquestionably one of the most acclaimed and widely read authors of all time. His novels have earned some of the world&#x2019;s most prestigious literary awards, and he has very genuinely been described as &#x201c;one of the most prolific and influential writers of the twentieth century.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>His earlier accomplishments are similarly impressive. As a barnstorming aviator through the 1930s he was known as &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; and broke local records for sustained glider flight. As a leader of expeditions, he is credited with conducting the first complete Puerto Rican mineralogical survey under United States protectorship and his navigational annotations still influence the maritime guides for British Columbia. His experimentation with early radio direction finding further became the basis for the Long Range Navigational system (Loran). And, as a lifelong photographer, his works have been displayed in galleries on two continents, with the definitive body of his photographs in traveling and permanent exhibits still drawing tens of thousands every year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among other avenues of research, Mr. Hubbard developed and codified an administrative technology that is utilized by more than 200,000 organizations worldwide, including multinational corporations, charitable bodies, political parties, schools, youth clubs and every imaginable small business. Likewise Mr. Hubbard&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed educational methods are utilized by more than a hundred thousand educators, while his equally acclaimed drug rehabilitation program has proven at least five times more effective than similarly aimed programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, however impressive these figures, no measure of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is complete without some appreciation of what became his life&#x2019;s work: Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; The world&#x2019;s most effective force for positive change, the Church of Scientology represents spiritual freedom for millions of people the world over. They come from every walk of life, every culture and every strata of society. Moreover, when one is speaking of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s discoveries relating to the human mind and spirit, one is ultimately speaking of the philosophic foundation of all he accomplished: better education, crime-free cities, drug-free campuses, stable and ethical organizations and cultural revitalization through the arts&#x2014;all this and more is made possible because of the breakthroughs in Dianetics and Scientology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Jhegaala (Vlad Taltos)</h2><p>New Hardcover Science Fiction</p><p><p>Steven Brust is the bestselling author of <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Issola</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Dzur</i>, among many others.

But eventually, I became convinced that I wasn&#x2019;t getting much lower, and soon enough, there was no question that I was in deep woods, with trees I can&#x2019;t name so close together I sometimes had to squeeze past them and with branches so low I had to duck to avoid getting hit in the face. The combination seemed unfair.<br>After that I felt more confident as I headed north, giving thanks for the occasional clearing, even though in the clearings I could see the Furnace, and it hurt my eyes.<br>I don&#x2019;t like forests. I hate the trees, and I hate the bushes, and I&#x2019;m not even that fond of the paths, because they have a way of either suddenly heading off in directions you don&#x2019;t want to go, or just stopping without giving you any explanation for their conduct. When I was running my territory for the Jhereg, if any of my people had acted like that I&#x2019;d have had their legs broken.<br>In the Pushta, you can usually see a good distance around you; you just have to keep an eye on what might be moving through the grasses. In the mountain, at least the mountains I&#x2019;ve been on, you can see for miles in at least a couple of directions. In the city, you might not be able to see very far, but you can identify where anyone who might want to do you harm could be lurking. Forests are thick, and anything can come from anywhere; I never feel safe.<br>And sleeping is the worst. I spent about three nights in the forest after I came down from the mountains, and I didn&#x2019;t get a good night&#x2019;s sleep the entire time, in spite of the fact that Loiosh and Rocza were watching for me. I just couldn&#x2019;t relax. When I become ruler of the world, I&#x2019;m going to have inns put up along every little road and trail in that place. I would certainly have gotten lost if it weren&#x2019;t for Loiosh and an occasional sight of the mountain.<br>I waded over several brooks and streams, one of which showed signs of becoming a river soon: it seemed to be in a terrible&nbsp; hurry, and had a lot of force for being only a foot or so deepand maybe ten feet wide. I didn&#x2019;t much care for that, either.<br>In spite of the annoyances, I was never in any danger so far as I know (though I&#x2019;m told Dzur sometimes hunt the forests). I made it through; leave it at that. The trees became lower, sparser, and the grass taller, with large, jagged boulders intruding on the landscape as if the mountain were encroaching.<br>&#x201c;Well, for marching blind, I guess we did all right, Loiosh.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We sure did, Boss. And only modesty forbids me from saying how we managed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Heh.&#x201d;<br>An hour or so later we found a road. A real road. I could have danced, if I could dance. It was getting on toward evening, and the Furnace was sinking behind the mountains. The shadows&#x2014;remarkably sharp, looking almost tangible&#x2014;were long, and a certain chill was coming into the air on a breeze from behind me. <br>&#x201c;That way,&#x201d; said my familiar, indicating down the road to the right. Since the mountains were to the left, I&#x2019;d have figured that one out on my own, but I didn&#x2019;t say anything. I set out. <br>After mountain and forest, it was a positive luxury to walk on a road; even a rutted, gouged, untended road like this. My feet thanked me, as did my left elbow, which was no longer being cracked by my sword&#x2019;s pommel when I raised my left leg to climb onto a rock.<br>For an hour or so, I saw no one and nothing save a lone farmhouse far across a field. The shadows lengthened and Loiosh was silent and my mind wandered.<br>I thought about Cawti, of course. A few weeks ago, I&#x2019;d been married. A few weeks before that, happily married; or at least I thought so. Anyone can make a mistake.<br>But what was odd was how little I was feeling it. It was pleasant walking down the road, and I was in good shape from all the climbing, and the evening wasn&#x2019;t too cold. I knew the whole thing was going to hit me&#x2014;I mean, I knew it. It was like seeing an out-of-control team barreling down on you, and watching it come closer, and knowing it&#x2019;s going to flatten you. Here it comes, yep, I&#x2019;m about to be either killed or messed up. Any second now. How interesting.<br>I could even be sort of dispassionate about it. I pondered whether I could convince her to take me back, and, if so, how? I ran through the arguments in my head, and they seemed very persuasive. I suspected they&#x2019;d be less so when I actually tried them on her. And, even if she was convinced, I&#x2019;d still have to deal with her politics, which is what had gotten between us in the first place.<br>And there was still the big problem, which was that circumstances had conspired to force me to save her. I don&#x2019;t know if I could have forgiven her if she had saved me; I didn&#x2019;t see how she could forgive me for saving her. It&#x2019;s an ugly burden. Eventually, I was going to have to try to overcome it. <br>And in the meantime, I was heading in the opposite direction, while somewhere behind there were people who wanted to get rich by putting the shine on me.<br>No, it didn&#x2019;t look good. <br>How interesting.&nbsp;&#x201c;We getting close to the water, Loiosh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wind shifted, Boss. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br>I should mention that nothing so far was at all familiar from my previous journey to Fenario, but that had been years before, and I wasn&#x2019;t paying all that much attention to my surroundings then.<br>With an abruptness that caught me by surprise, it was dark&#x2014;I mean completely dark. There were small pinpoints of light in the sky, but they provided no illumination. Maybe they should have; I was told by a human physicker once that I had poor night vision. I could have had it corrected, but the process is painful, and a spell to compensate is absurdly easy. Except, of course, when you are unable to cast the simplest of spells for fear of removing the protections that keep the bad guys from finding you. So for now, little points of light or no, I was effectively blind. I wondered if failing to have that fixed when I could would end up being what did me in. Come to think of it, I still wonder.<br>I stepped a few paces off the road, and, having no better idea, took off my pack, spread out my blanket, and lay down. Loiosh and Rocza, I knew, would take care of any annoying beasts, and wake me if there were any dangerous ones. It wasn&#x2019;t until I was prone that I became aware of the sound of night insects all around me. I wondered if they were the sort that bit; then sleep took me.<br>Evidently they weren&#x2019;t the sort that bit.<br>I&#x2019;d been walking about two hours the next day before I passed a young man driving a wagon filled with hay. I hailed him, and he stopped the horse&#x2014;one of the biggest I&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;and greeted me. I had the impression he was a bit disconcerted by the jhereg on my shoulders, but was too polite to say anything. &#x201c;Which way to Burz?&#x201d; I asked him.<br>He pointed the way I was going. &#x201c;Over the bridge,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;in a while the road will fork, and there&#x2019;s a sign. You&#x2019;ll likely smell it after that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good enough,&#x201d; I told him, and gave him a couple of copper pennies. He tapped his forehead, which I took as a gesture of thanks, and continued on his way.<br>I suddenly felt as if I was too relaxed, not paying enough attention, and resolved to stay a little more on my guard. Then it hit me that I had now made that resolution around a dozen times since coming down out of the mountains.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling safe, Loiosh. As if I&#x2019;m out of danger. I can&#x2019;t decide if I should trust that feeling.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure, Boss, but I&#x2019;ve been feeling the same way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like we&#x2019;re out of their reach?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, we probably are, but let&#x2019;s not trust it too much.&#x201d;<br>I found the bridge&#x2014;it spanned a stream maybe twenty feet wide&#x2014;and went &#x201c;a while,&#x201d; which turned out to be most of the rest of the day. Once over the bridge, the road abruptly improved, showing signs of regular maintenance. I stopped a couple of times to eat bread, cheese, and sausage I&#x2019;d gotten in Saestara (the village, not the mountain). The bread was getting stale, but it was still better than the hardtack. As I walked, I noticed that the forest, which I had thought was left behind me, seemed to be returning on my right; or maybe it was a different forest. I ought to have tried to find a map, I suppose, but I&#x2019;m told they are hard to come by and rarely reliable.<br>Over the next several hours, the forest seemed to come closer, but avoided the road (I know, the road w...</p><h2>How to Poo on a Date: The Lovers&#39; Guide to Toilet Etiquette</h2><p><b>All&nbsp;the information you need to survive any romantic toilet-related problem&#x2014;certain to make as big a splash as <i>How to Poo at Work</i></b> <p></p><p>Now toilet etiquett-sperts Mats &amp; Enzo have turned their attention and extensive experience to what is surely one of the most important questions that has played on the mind of mankind for centuries: how to poo on a date.

That's what Reverend Deborah L. Johnson did in 1995. In a moment of darkness, there was nothing she could do but surrender: "Take me now, oh Lord." Almost instantly she heard whispers&#x2014;and they turned into more than 300 letters from Spirit. With <i>The Sacred Yes</i>, Rev. Deborah offers 54 of these epistles that provide not only soothing, affirmative wisdom, but words that lift us to our highest place of being.</p><p>Each letter is a conversation, discrete in its own message, explains Rev. Johnson&#x2014;whose Omnifaith Inner Light Ministries is the spiritual community of more than 1,500 people. The lessons are universal, addressing the human condition common to us all. They provide solace, insight, and inspiration for our hurts, fears, hopes, hesitations, and aspirations.</p><p><i>The Sacred Yes</i> speaks to us individually and collectively, providing new paradigms for our interpersonal relationships, societal institutions, and global affairs. The act of unconditional surrender to the unknown&#x2014;without reservation or hesitation&#x2014;is what transforms every circumstance into something that benefits us all. And according to Rev. Deborah L. Johnson, it happens with one sacred word ... Yes.</p><p>NOTE: Also available on CD</p></p><p><b>Deborah L. Johnson</b><br><p>Rev. Deborah L. Johnson is the founder and president of Inner Light Ministries&#x2014;the omnifaith spiritual community of more than 1,500 people in Northern California. A dynamic public speaker, she is an MBA consultant to Fortune 500 companies, and travels the nation teaching, training, and consulting on cultural diversity. Rev. Deborah is a lifetime civil rights activist, and her work has been featured in numerous books, magazines, and television programs including appearances on Showtime's <i>Black Filmmaker Showcase: Jumpin' the Broom, The Phil Donahue Show,</i> and <i>Nightline.</i></p>A Northern California spiritual leader, writer, activist, and consultant reads a group of letters she automatically wrote "from Spirit." Offering guidance, hope, and well-crafted solutions to many vexing challenges, the letters reach into the deepest resistances people have to a Divine connection. A dramatic reader, the author will sound morally relativistic to conservative ears; she's a cutting-edge liberal and social rights activist. But the message of the letters is clearly Christian; they are meant to encourage integrity, loyalty, love, commitment, responsible child-rearing, and respect for others. Something in this eloquent statement of principles will reach listeners in ways that can't be understood in rational terms.

One that has room for questions, victories, failures, and mystery.

He writes weekly for WorldMag.com and <i>The Blazing Center </i>as well as blogging at BarnabasPiper.com and co-hosting the Happy Rant Podcast. He and his wife live in the Nashville area with their two daughters.Barnabas Piper issues a powerful call to leave the gridlock of black-and-white thinking and enter the gray terrain of second-guessing and doubt. This is where we raise our toughest, most honest questions to God. Such an invitation doesn t push us from the gospel but draws us nearer to the heart of Christ. May we all learn to pray, Help my unbelief. --Margaret Feinberg (07/01/2015)"<br><br>Too often our struggles with doubt are hidden, pushed into the back of the cupboard like a corrosive agent that is too dangerous to touch. With clarity, warmth, and candor, Barnabas Piper shows us that doubt does not have to be something that corrodes, but rather in its right place can be something that strengthens faith. --Mark Sayers (07/01/2015)"<br><br>Barnabas Piper s "Help My Unbelief" is an honest, self-revealing, and engaging treatment of an important subject. This winsome and well-reasoned book avoids cliches and easy, superficial answers. It will benefit many including those who doubt, those who sort of believe, and those who believe yet long to do so more completely. --Randy Alcorn (07/01/2015)"<br><br>Sometimes believers can give the impression that the Christian life is always one of triumph and confidence. This book by Barnabas Piper counsels us on how to trust God when our faith is weak and wavering. It calls us away from a demon-like faith that simply knows the data about God, to a childlike faith that cries out, I believe; help my unbelief. If you find yourself doubting, or if you love someone who doubts, this book will refresh and encourage. --Russell Moore (07/01/2015)"<br><br>"Help My Unbelief" gives the church permission to exhale. It s a book that pulls up a chair and looks in the eyes of the doubter and says, You re not alone, friend. Doubt, says Barnabas Piper, is not the antithesis of Faith. Rather, it s a gateway. The key is to ask the right questions, and to be open to God s answers. For this particular disillusioned pastor s daughter, Piper s words are a lifeline and the key to drawing today s youth back into Christendom. --Emily T. Wierenga (07/01/2015)"<br><br>I m really excited for you to read Barnabas s new book, "Help My Unbelief: Why Doubt Is Not the Enemy of Faith." Barnabas writes in a ruthlessly honest and raw way. This book is going to help an entire generation grow and blossom in their faith in the midst of wrestling with doubt. --Derwin L. Gray (07/01/2015)"<br><br>In "Help My Unbelief," Barnabas Piper makes a clear and compelling case for faith amid the sea of doubts many experience in Christianity. It s a necessary book for our generation. --Matt Carter (07/01/2015)"<br><br>Some Christians have a simple faith unencumbered by doubt. For the rest of us, things aren t so easy. We question. We second-guess. We always want to know why. "Help My Unbelief" is the perfect book for us. With accessible prose and unflinching honesty, Barnabas explores belief that encompasses, is even strengthened by, doubt. Anyone navigating a faith filled with doubts will find Barnabas to be a sympathetic and reliable guide. --Drew Dyck (07/01/2015)"<br><br>Barnabas Piper s "Help My Unbelief" is an encouraging, honest look at an essential but underdiscussed aspect of faith: the tension between belief and unbelief. It s a tension that need not be feared. Piper shows us, rather, how the tension can be healthy and ultimately leave us stronger in our faith. For any believer who has felt alone in their wrestle with unbelief, or who was mistakenly taught that true belief is always ironclad, this valuable and timely book is for you. --Brett McCracken (07/01/2015)"</p><h2>The Toynbee Convector</h2><p>A superlative new collection of twenty-two stories by the author of &#34;The Martian Chronicles&#34; includes the continuating saga of H.G.

Storytelling itself is the theme of a number of these short narratives; Bradbury understands that a primary function of fiction is to act as a guidepost back to the emotional richness of childhood and adolescence. In "On the Orient, North" a ghost, at the point of dissipation, rejuvenates itself by telling scary winter's tales to a group of children. In "Banshee" a screenwriter and a director tell each other disturbing cautionary talesone narrator, to the other's misfortune, is not making it up. The fey souls in "The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair" find their relationship cannot withstand a little hard reality. The title story concerns a man who claims to have traveled into the future and declares that there the world's problems have been resolved. He produces documentation of his claims and lives to see the realization of his vision, even though a vision is all it is. The documentation turns out to be fabrications, but the hope it had inspired allows mankind to bring about its own salvation. The fiction creates the truth in this lovely exercise in utopian dreaming. 30,000 first printing; BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.An old woman learns what it truly means to believe in ghosts in "On the Orient, North"; another woman discovers a mysterious "Trapdoor" in a house she has occupied for years; and an old man attempts to change his own past in "A Touch of Petulance" in this new collection of 23 stories by one of sf's grand masters.

Among current designers featured are Vera Wang, Roberto Cavalli, Luella Bartley, Zac Posen, Roland Mouret and Viktor and RoIf. </p><p> An A to Z section highlights over 250 of the greatest designers of all time -- the men and women who have inspired, created and altered the course of fashion. Illustrated with many eye-catching archival images, Vogue Fashion also features the work of the photographers who have helped immortalize seminal fashion moments. </p><p> <b>Vogue Fashion</b> is an informative and inspirational look at how fashion reflects and projects social mores and individual values. </p></p><p><p> <b>Linda Watson</b> is a fashion journalist who has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers. She was a fashion writer for <i>Vogue</i> magazine for four years and is the co-author of <i>Vogue's More Dash Than Cash</i>. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>Dressing is the fourth bodily function. After breathing, eating and sleeping -- and excluding a couple of delicious optional extras -- one of the fundamental pleasures of the human body is to clothe it. Which makes fashion -- it's closest relation -- pretty important.</p> <p>The history of fashion touches everyone in its orbit. It runs far, far deeper than hemlines, silhouettes and colours. It is intrinsically caught up with social mores and mood changes in everything from food to mannerisms, music to sex. It lives and exists not only as one of the most ravishing and compelling of entertainments but as the surest indicator of time. Humour has always been part of its charm.</p> <p>Throughout the twentieth century, <i>Vogue</i> has acted as a visual filter. Each season designers have thrown ideas into the air and <i>Vogue</i> has caught them and sprinkled them over its pages. It has always been down to the century's social animals -- and significant figures -- whether designs transcended history or froze in suspended animation. Diana, Princess of Wales, had everything: genetic perfection, model dimensions, royal connections and the mystique of a silent-movie star. Add fashion, and the result was that she became the most photographed woman on the planet.</p> <p>In 1909 electricity was a new sensation, and it was shocking if a woman showed an ankle. By 1916, if she smoked in public, <i>Vogue</i> concluded, 'She must be an actress.' If she wore red lipstick, she was the next best thing to a prostitute. The wearing of a veil had orgasmic powers. Trousers were slammed as 'audacious'. If bumsters had been around, Alexander McQueen would have been locked up and labelled certifiable.</p> <p>Today, following the new millennium, no one bats an eyelid if dresses skim the nipples, navels are exposed and the bottom half of the buttocks are aired to ancient relatives. Nudity -- the natural conclusion -- will never be in fashion, not just because the weather wouldn't allow it, but because it is the only style that would put the whole industry on social security.</p> <p>Ever since Eve wore a fig leaf, fashion has been associated with two things: defining sexuality and committing outrageous behaviour. Even fastenings aren't immune. Consider the zip -- 'Zippergate' -- a little metal fastening that almost brought down the president of America in 1998.</p> <p>The biggest change has been in the status of the designer, who until the 1950s was considered a dictator, then a director and a suggester. Now he or she airs their opinions, controls huge empires and emblazons their name across every part of your anatomy. In turn, we want to see where they live, hear what they think, find out how they function. We sleep on their pillowcases, pull their curtains across our windows, spray ourselves with their scent: the most potent way to get style under the skin.</p> <p>The fly-past of designers' behaviour throughout the last century is a seminal lesson to those who are thinking of taking up fashion design professionally. The most financially successful designers have brilliant business partners; the most creative have a single vision; the most famous are those who either have visionary tendencies or big mouths. Sometimes both. Then there are the handful of geniuses who put beauty and art before everything -- and inevitably ended up with nothing: the great Orientalist, Paul Poiret, once held the fashion world in the palm of his hand; the brilliant Ossie Clark, who could cut like a dream but couldn't handle his own talent; Charles James, who was posthumously revered, but spent his declining years in New York's seedy Chelsea Hotel with sketches, toiles and an Afro wig for company. Passion and fashion -- unless there is a business brain in the frame -- just don't mix.</p> <p>Age and body shape are part of the fashion template. In 1909 the face said 20, the waist said 15, the bosom 50. Flappers started smoking furiously in an attempt to echo the streamline shape of a greyhound. By 1960 there was the ludicrous situation where women of 40-plus were dressing like 10-year-olds. A hundred years from now, fashion historians flicking through this book, en route to a fortnight on the moon, may assume that millennium woman looked like Kate Moss. We don't.</p> <p>Today, there is more choice than ever. Status symbols on every seam. We are in a world of international fashion, but the elegance on the street has gone. The skill that required time, talent and a steady hand reached its peak of perfection in the 1950s and went rapidly downhill after the advent of television. Before 1960 women were fitted by their dressmakers. Now we make our own decisions on what size we are. Not wise. As Jean Muir once observed, 'People make pictures of themselves that other people have to look at.'</p> <p>For fashion, read: prediction. In the 1920s Cecil Beaton imagined that nuns would wear cubes on their heads and brides would wear bodysuits. In the 1960s Yves Saint Laurent said he would prefer taking a pill to actually eating a proper meal. He was not alone: in the mid-twentieth century almost everyone believed that by the year 2000 we would be wearing spacesuits to the office and would be coming home to have our dinner with a robot.</p> <p>What of the future? American minimalist Geoffrey Beene has been saying for years that 'the fundamental change will happen when the chemist meets the artist'. We already have temperature-sensitive and virtually indestructible fabrics. In the future, pundits predict clothes with in-built mobile phones; shops where we don't rifle through rails but pick prototypes, and our measurements are drawn up on a computer. No doubt, one day, someone will invent a range of skirts that have meaningful conversations with washing machines...</p> <p>Designers are currently floating the idea of fashion shows on the internet. But can fashion editors exist in a world devoid of gossip, seating arrangements and air kissing? Virtual reality in solitary confinement? Highly unlikely. For fashion is not -- and never has been -- about the clothes. It's about people. Until genetic engineers decree otherwise. As long as the average human body is made up of four basic components -- one head, two arms, two legs and fleshy undulations in the middle -- fashion will continue to excite and delight within those strict, but endlessly fascinating, perimeters.</p></p><h2>Book of Fables: The Yiddish Fable Collection of Reb Moshe Wallich (Raphael Patai Series in Jewish Folklore and Anthropology)</h2><p><p>Book of Fables is a bilingual edition of Sefer Mesholim, an important collection of fables that was published in Yiddish in 1695. Occupying a significant and interesting place in Yiddish literary history, Sefer Mesholim provides valuable insight regarding the development of Yiddish language and literature and offers an unusual perspective on the cultural and social life of contemporary<br>European Jewry.</p><p>Now, almost three hundred years after its original publication, Eli Katz has translated the thirty-four fables of Sefer Mesholim, derived principally from the Aesopic canon, and from both medieval Hebrew and German sources. The fables themselves were first adapted for a Yiddish reading audience in 1597 in Verona, Italy, and in the adaptation<br>acquired a distinctively Ashkenazic Jewish flavor with much local Italian-Jewish vocabulary and coloration.</p><p>To place this particular book of traditional tales in context with its time and culture, Katz discusses the early development of Yiddish literature in European publishing. His extensive appendices and critical apparatus<br>document his decisions as a translator and the peculiarities of the early edition, detailing the interesting ways in which Moses Wallich modified the original collection for his audience of a century later.</p><p>This comprehensive volume presents 115 reproductions of the original pages with handsome, intricate woodcut illustrations opposite the translation of the text. By providing Yiddish text as it appeared hundreds of years ago, Katz facilitates access by scholars in the fields of Yiddish language, literature, and folklore, and areas of more general Jewish social history.</p></p><p>Book of Fables is a bilingual edition of Sefer Mesholim, an important collection of fables that was published in Yiddish in 1695.Eli Katz, Professor Emeritus of Euro-American Studies and Linguistics at Sonoma Valley State University in California, received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles.

His arrival, along with that of another youngster who becomes fag to Gethryn, leads to much excitement and scandal in the school, and the disruption of some important cricket matches.</p><p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was an English humorist, whose body of work includes novels, short stories, plays, poems, song lyrics and numerous pieces of journalism.

From 1863 to the end of the conflict, Mosby's raiders were a constant headache for the North. Although more than 1,000 men served under Mosby, they usually acted in small detachments of several dozen, sacking supply depots, attacking railroads, and harassing federal troops. They seemed to move behind enemy lines almost at will, and in what is perhaps their most celebrated exploit, a handful of them led by Mosby himself rode into Fairfax Station, Virginia, in the dead of the night and kidnapped a Union general. When they were not on missions, Mosby's riders simply melted into the countryside, finding safe haven in the homes of sympathetic civilians. Theirs was a guerilla war. The frustrated North eventually assigned a special contingent of cavalry to combat them, and a price was ultimately put on Mosby's head. Nobody reined him in, however, and his command enjoyed the proud distinction of never having formally surrendered to the bluecoats. Shortly after Appomattox, Mosby simply disbanded his unit. This is another fine book from the prolific Civil War historian Jeffry D. Wert, who hardly could have picked a more intriguing subject. <i>--John J. Miller</i><b>Jeffrey D.

A former history teacher at Penns Valley High School, he lives in Centre Hall, Pennsylvania, slightly more than one hour from the battlefield at Gettysburg.</p><h2>Essential Fashion Illustration</h2><p>This book's aim is to submerge the reader in the world of illustration. The first section ranges from how to start to draw a human figure to the techniques to stylize and synthesize it. This section provides a large amount of figures in different poses, as well as hands and feet-often the most difficult parts - in diverse postures and angles. However, in the field of fashion it is also essential to know how to draw fabric, and even more important to know how to draw the folds of clothing. The items of clothing are presented as much in technical drawing as in figures in movement, and forming light and shadow is also explained, as this gives quality to the illustration.<p>The second part of the book revolves around color and the different techniques with which one can work: watercolor, wax, pastel, and so on. All the drawings that appear constitute a brief exhibition of the changes that the fashion world has experienced and with this in mind a path has been laid which starts in 1900, illustrated in watercolors, and finishes in 2000, illustrated in pencil. The goal of this volume is to uncover the reader's desire to paint and to provide him with some of the secrets that will encourage him to do so. After all, experience is the most effective way to learn, whatever the subject.</p></p><p>Maite Lafuente is a professor at the European Institute of Fashion.

But being a purely digital product&#x2014;albeit one available via computer, smartphone, tablet, printer, and refrigerator&#x2014;left some of our passionate community desiring one thing more&#x2014;a printed cookbook. Some wanted it so they could read the book in bed, salivating over the food photography and delicious recipe titles. Others asked from a more practical point of view, saying they still liked to cook from an actual book, pages collecting flour and absorbing grease as the tangible proof of a delicious memory. And then a vocal minority just wanted to know what recipes we editors liked most, asking us to act as curators.</p> <p>So, we took up the charge, selecting from amongst the top-rated recipes voted by users. The process was, well, lengthy. Try going through a database that numbers 200,000, choosing from amongst the best of the best, created by the likes of <em>Gourmet </em>and <em>Bon App�tit </em>magazines, top cookbook authors like Edna Lewis, Dorie Greenspan, and Bruce Aidell, renowned chefs like David Chang, Tom Colicchio, and Jonathon Waxman. It was hard! Arguments ensued. Knives were drawn at dawn&#x2014;umm . . . kitchen knives . . .</p> <p>We decided to structure the book the way we all eat and cook&#x2014;by season&#x2014;then by meal course or type. Because we love and value our community, we also chose to feature some of our most talented home cook recipes, and gave them the royal treatment&#x2014;testing, cross-testing, and then editing and photographing their family recipes. We strove to find the perfect member comment to add editorial insight into each recipe and wrote headnotes that supplied menu ideas, cooking tips, and substitutions. We created menus so that any reader could just flip to the back and get a preplanned meal. And, finally, we convinced legendary food photographer Ellen Silverman, who had just come off shooting Gwyneth Paltrow's cookbook, to render shots of the dishes just as they would look in any of our kitchens&#x2014;rustic, fresh, tasty.</p> <p>And so here we are, about to give birth to Epicurious' first-ever cookbook.

Never have more people accomplished more things in more different fields than they are accomplishing today. More people are becoming successful at a faster rate than at any other time in history. There have never been more opportunities for you to turn your dreams into realities than there are right now.<br><br>Leading futurists and prominent businesspeople are predicting that mankind is entering a Golden Age. The Western ideals of democracy, individual liberty and free enterprise are sweeping the globe and bringing prosperity, growth and human freedom wherever they are seriously tried. There has probably never been a better time for you to achieve greater success, freedom, happiness and financial independence than at this very moment.<br><br>This book will show you how to improve your life, achieve your goals and realize your full potential for success and happiness. No matter who you are or what your situation, you have within you, right now, the ability to accomplish more than you ever have before. You have the potential to exceed all your previous levels of accomplishment. You can be, have and do more than perhaps you have ever imagined. All you need to do is to learn how, and then put what you learn into action.<br><br>Everything in this book has been tested and proven in the crucible of real life. My own experience has made me a sort of guinea pig for these ideas. If I had designed my early life as an ideal test case, I probably couldn't have done better. I started so far behind that no one could have blamed me for not amounting to anything.<br><br><i>MY OWN STORY</i><br><br>I was born in Canada in 1944. My parents were good people and hard-working but we never seemed to have enough money. I still remember my parents saying over and over as I was growing up, "We can't afford it, we can't afford it, we can't afford it." No matter what it was, we couldn't afford it. They had been through the Great Depression and they had never fully recovered from the experience of worrying about money all the time.<br><br>When I entered my teens, I became aware for the first time that many other families seemed to be doing far better than we were. They had nicer homes, newer clothes and better cars. They seemed not to worry as much about money as we did, and they seemed to be able to afford a lot of things that our family couldn't even dream of. It was about this time that I began asking the question, "Why is it that some people are more successful than others?"<br><br>I began wondering why it was that some people seemed to earn more money, have happier relationships and families, live in more beautiful homes and generally get much more joy and satisfaction out of life than others did.<br><br>As it happened, I had a lot of time to think about this question, because I spent a lot of time by myself. I was what was called a "loser." I fooled around in class. I ran around with a bad bunch of kids. I was always shooting my mouth off trying to get attention, and I eventually became very unpopular.<br><br>It's said that everyone is good for something, even if it's just to set a bad example. That was me. I was the kid that parents and teachers pointed to as a warning. "If you don't straighten up,' they said, "you'll end up like Tracy."<br><br>When I was sixteen, I had the first revelation that led to changing the course of my life. It dawned on me one day that if I ever wanted things to change for me, then it was up to me to change. If I didn't like being unhappy and unpopular, and in trouble all the time, then it was up to me to do something about it. This began in earnest my lifelong search for the answer to the question, "Why are some people more successful than others?"<br><br>After dropping out of high school and working as a laborer for a couple of years, I finally saved a little money and went off to see the world.<br><br>I have since traveled or worked in more than eighty countries on six continents. I have been in situations and had experiences that most people could not imagine. I have been dirt poor, going without food and sleeping on the ground countless times in far and foreign lands.<br><br>I have also stayed in beautiful hotels and dined in fine restaurants in the great cities of the world. In time, I became a senior executive of a $265 million development company. I've met four presidents and three prime ministers. My wife and I even had dinner with the president of the United States less than six months after setting it as a goal.<br><br>Over the years, mostly in retrospect, I learned a variety of lessons, and one of the most important is this: You can't hit a target you can't see. You can't accomplish wonderful things with your life if you have no idea of what they are. You must first become absolutely clear about what you want if you are serious about unlocking the extraordinary power that lies within you.<br><br>Every success I've ever enjoyed came after I had taken the time to think through what my goal would look like when it was accomplished. I have since met and spoken with many men and women who have achieved great success and they all had that one trait in common. They knew exactly what they wanted. They all had a clear picture of what their ideal lives and accomplishments would look like. This vision of the kind of future they wanted to create for themselves became a powerful motivator that drove them onward. The realization of their goals seemed to flow from the exercise of establishing them in the first place.<br><br>Goal setting is an important element of this system, and I'll be explaining it in detail in Chapter Five. But well before you do that, you have to do something that very few people ever do. It is absolutely essential to making this system work, and it is this: You have to decide exactly what "success" means to you. You have to decide what your life would look like if you made it into a masterpiece.<br><br>Here's how you begin. Use "zero-based thinking." Imagine you could go back to the beginning in every situation in your life and start over. Like holding up a picture frame and viewing different parts of your life and relationships through it, ask this question: "If I had this decision to make today, knowing what I now know, what would I do?"<br><br>Refuse to compromise on your answers. Be perfectly honest with yourself. Define your ideal in each situation before you allow yourself to get bogged down with all the reasons it isn't possible for you. All great achievement begins with your deciding what it is you really want and then dedicating yourself wholeheartedly to attaining it.<br><br><i>THE SEVEN INGREDIENTS OF SUCCESS</i><br><br>Anything that you could ever want more of, or any factor that you would consider important to your happiness, can be placed in one of seven categories. These Seven Ingredients of Success are consistent with everything ever written or discovered on success and happiness. They characterize the life and accomplishments of all high-performing men and women. They include everything you could ever want.<br><br>Your ideal life is a blending of these seven ingredients in exactly the combination that makes you the happiest at any particular moment. By defining your success and happiness in terms of one or more of these seven ingredients, you create a clear target to aim it. You can then measure how well you're doing. You can identify the areas where you need to make changes if you want your life to improve.<br><br>You must start with your ideal, your vision of a perfect future. You begin unlocking your inner powers by lifting up your eyes and "seeing" your life exactly as if it were already perfect in every respect. Your first job is to create a blueprint, a clear picture of where you are going and what it will look like when you get there. This image will then serve as an organizing principle, a guide, a benchmark, against which you can measure and compare everything you do in the process of turning it into your reality.<br><br><i>PEACE OF MIND</i><br><br>The first of these seven ingredients of success, and easily the most important, is peace of mind. It is the highest human good. Without it, nothing else has much value. Because of this, you strive for it all your life. You usually evaluate how well you are doing at any given time by how much inner peace you enjoy.<br><br>Peace of mind is your internal gyroscope. When you are living in harmony with your highest values and your innermost convictions -- when you are perfectly balanced in life -- then you enjoy peace of mind. If, for any reason, you compromise your values, or go against your inner guidance, your peace of mind is the first thing to suffer.<br><br>Peace of mind, or harmony, is essential for the optimal performance of all human groupings, from your relationships with your Mends and family members to the businesses and organizations in which you work. All interactions among people thrive on harmonious relationships. All manners, morals, etiquette and diplomacy are organized around the desire each person has to assure his or her peace of mind by not disrupting the peace of mind of others.<br><br>In corporations, peace of mind can be measured in terms of the amount of harmony that exists among coworkers. Productive, profitable companies are those in which people feel good about themselves. They feel safe and happy at work. They may be busy, even frantic with activity, but they are at peace inside.<br><br>The wonderful truth about peace of mind is that it is your normal, natural condition. Happiness is your birthright. It belongs to you. It is not something you experience occasionally if you're lucky. Peace of mind is central to your very existence. It is the basic precondition for enjoying everything else.<br><br>Achieving inner peace must be a central organizing principle of your life. It must become the overarching goal to which all your other goals are subservient. In fact, you are only successful as a person to the degree to which you can achieve your own happiness, your own contentment, your own sense of personal well-being -- in short, your own peace of mind.<br><br>The very idea of specifically aiming at the achievement of my own happiness caused me a good deal of confusion and anxiety at one time. My religious background had drummed into me the idea that my own personal happiness was not a valid consideration for my choices and behaviors.<br><br>If anything, I was told that happiness was merely a by-product of living my life to make others happy. If I got any happiness, I was informed, I was just lucky. And if I didn't, then that was my lot in life. The very idea of setting happiness as a specific goal for myself was described as selfish and uncaring.<br><br>A major turning point came for me when I learned two things. First, I learned that if I didn't commit to achieving my own happiness, no one else would. If my aim in life was only to make others happy, I would always be at the mercy of the feelings of others, whoever they might be. And I found that trying to organize my life around making others happy was an unending exercise in frustration and disappointment, because it just wasn't possible.<br><br>Second, I discovered that I couldn't give away what I didn't have. I couldn't make someone else happy by being miserable myself. As Abraham Lincoln once said, "You can't help the poor by becoming one of them." I found that I couldn't make others happy unless I could make myself happy first.<br><br>Peace of mind is so important to everything else you accomplish that it must be subjected to rigorous analysis. Where does it come from? Under what conditions does it exist for you? How can you get more of it?<br><br>In the simplest terms, you experience happiness and peace of mind whenever you are completely free from the destructive emotions of fear, anger, doubt, guilt, resentment and worry. In the absence of negative emotions, you enjoy peace of mind naturally, effortlessly. The key to happiness then is to systematically eliminate, or at least minimize, the parts of your life that cause you negativity or stress of any kind.<br><br>This idea bowled me over when I first came across it many years ago. Imagine! The way to live a happy, productive life is to achieve your own peace of mind by systematically eliminating the negative people, situations and emotions that make you unhappy.<br><br>Wow! Could happiness in life be that simple? And herein lies the rub. The major obstacle to eliminating the negativity that interferes with your happiness is your attachment to the negative people and situations that cause it. Your rational mind comes up with all kinds of clever reasons why you must continue in your existing situation. Instead of working for you, instead of providing you with solutions to your problems, your amazing brain works frantically to keep you mired in them.<br><br>Later in this book, I'll show you a variety of ways to control, and eventually eliminate, your negative emotions. I'll show you powerful techniques you can use to neutralize anger and worry in moments. I'll show you how to take complete control of your emotions and how to keep them positive most of the time.<br><br>For the moment, though, your job is to engage in what is called "mountaintop thinking." Project forward in thought and imagine your ideal life. What combination of ingredients would have to exist for you to be perfectly happy? Don't worry about what's possible or not possible for you at the moment. Free your mind from all limitations and be perfectly selfish. Just define your life exactly as it would have to be for you to enjoy the peace of mind you desire.<br><br>What would you be doing? Where would you be living? Who would be there with you? How would you spend your time, day in and day out? Remember, you can't hit a target you can't see. But if you can envision it clearly, there's a very good likelihood that you can achieve it!<br><br>If you're in business, create this ideal future vision of what your job or work would look like if it was absolutely excellent in every respect. What would you do more of (or less of) to achieve higher levels of harmony and cooperation in your work environment?<br><br>In your family, what would your life look like if you and the people you care about were living in a state of complete peace and contentment? What sort of things would you do to help others to be happy in the process of achieving your own happiness?<br><br>When you set peace of mind as your goal and plan everything you do in terms of whether it helps or hinders your attainment of that goal, you'll probably never make another mistake. You'll do and say the right things. You'll find yourself operating from a higher set of principles. You'll feel wonderful about yourself. Peace of mind is the key.<br><br><i>HEALTH AND ENERGY</i><br><br>The second ingredient of success is health and energy. Just as peace of mind is your normal and natural mental state, health and energy is your normal and natural physical state.<br><br>Your body has a natural bias toward health. It produces energy easily and in abundance in the absence of mental or physical interference. And radiant health exists in the absence of any pain, illness or disease. Wonderfully enough, your body is constructed in such a way that if you just stop doing certain things to it, it often recovers and becomes healthy and energetic all by itself.<br><br>If you achieve all kinds of things in the material world, but you lose your health or your peace of mind, you get little or no pleasure from your other accomplishments.<br><br>Imagine yourself enjoying perfect health. Think of how you would be if you were your ideal image of physical fitness. How would you look? How would you feel? How much would you weigh? What sort of foods would you eat and what kind of exercis...</p><h2>Batman by Ed Brubaker Vol. 1</h2><p>Award-winning writer Ed Brubaker begins his legendary run on the title as the Batman goes head-to-head with a seemingly unstoppable assassin. <br><br> Someone has been spying on the Dark Knight from the shadows, studying his fighting style and planning a counterattack.

Dr. Eggerichs' best-selling book, "Love &amp; Respect," launched a revolution in how couples relate to each other based on Ephesians 5:33: "The husband must love his wife . . . and the wife must respect her husband." In "Cracking the Communication Code," he shows couples how to decipher what they are really saying to each other and how to speak each other's distinctly different language - repsect for him, love for her.

He is the parking attendant in the little historical town of Fiesole where I go to work every day. You know the routine: After you park, you put coins in a machine, print a piece of paper, and leave it on the dashboard; from that moment, time ticks away in the back of your mind. Roberto walks around and checks. In theory, it&#x2019;s not a likable role. But Roberto is the most popular guy in town. He is everybody&#x2019;s friend. When he sees me he tells me about how he went to the top of the church tower, and how beautiful the landscape is from there, or he lets me know my car&#x2019;s left front tire is a bit low, or describes Fiesole as it used to be when he was a kid&#x2014;and he does this with everybody. If you transgress, he will give you a friendly warning, because he knows everybody&#x2019;s car and where everyone is, and often&#x2014;believe it or not&#x2014;he has come to ring the doorbell at my studio to remind me it&#x2019;s time to pay. He will let you cheat a bit on time&#x2014;but not too much. He hates taking out the green notebook and writing a fine. But usually there is no need, because everybody feels treated well, and everyone pays. In these days of rising impersonality, when a computer voice will say hello and thank you at the supermarket, and people look at their smartphones and not at you, and eat in front of a screen, and die alone, warmth and human contact are a dangerously dwindling resource, and a man like Roberto is almost a miracle. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> So this is what the book is about: the kindness that can fill your days; the kindness which is abundant in the human spirit, yet paradoxically at risk of extinction. It is the warmth, the attention, the care, the contact we all yearn for. The key point is: If you are kind to others you are kind to yourself, and if you are kind to yourself you are also kind to others. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> I will start from an angle that you may find unexpected: time, the most mysterious of all subjects. You will soon see how it ties in with kindness. So let me ask you right away: How are you doing for time? Do you feel that you have tons of it and there is no rush, that you inhabit your existence with a plentiful and happy feeling of time affluence? Or, on the contrary, does it seem to you that time is never enough, and do you feel dismay when you have to waste even a few minutes? Do you experience time a s inexorably running out and disappearing like sand in the last seconds of an hourglass? &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> Whatever your orientation is, chances are you wouldn&#x2019;t mind some extra time. After all, time is the stuff your life is made of. Now, suppose you have a busy schedule and feel your time is not enough. Let&#x2019;s imagine that, instead of reducing engagements, you add one more and become a volunteer&#x2014;you read books to children in the hospital, for instance, or walk orphaned dogs, or clean up a beach. Then you ask yourself again how you feel about your time. Would your time shortage have reached red alert? The answer should be obvious: Subtract the time for an extra commitment, and you end up having less time. Right? Well, no. At the end of the day you would likely feel you have more time. At least this is what recent research on time affluence suggests. The heart follows a different kind of math: Acts of kindness and generosity increase our feeling of time affluence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> However exact our measurements of time may be, we cannot ignore one crucial point: Time is subjective. Our own inner time may stretch or shrink; and the same amount of time ahead of us (say, a holiday or a tax audit) may look to us as painfully short or threateningly large. In our best moments time disappears&#x2014;at least for a few instants: We are absorbed in love or beauty or wonder, and the ticking of seconds seems to be suspended and forgotten. Those are the moments we treasure most. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>We are looking at the mind&#x2019;s deep structure here: Time defines our whole existence. What brain circuit is activated, what mental space is opened that makes us feel we are rich in hours and days, and makes time a friend rather than a gremlin? Enter kindness. Among the many inner changes it can trigger, one is to make us feel we have more freedom and breathing space. Kindness is not just an add-on. As we shall see again and again in this book, it is a state of being.<br><br> Interest in the health benefits of kindness has burgeoned during the past few years. That is, of course, a wonderful and reassuring trend. I see a danger, though: to think of kindness as we think of broccoli or exercise&#x2014;just one other device for better health. That is still a good thing: Exercising your body and eating healthy foods are good habits. In the case of kindness, however, the risk is that an overly exterior attitude (&#x201c;I will do an act of kindness because it releases more serotonin&#x201d;) would make us overlook the essence. And that may slow us down in exploring the vast and wondrous territories of love. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> So before we all eagerly line up to earn the rewards of kindness, let us try a thought experiment: Paradoxically imagine that kindness gives none of the benefits science has been claiming; pretend that scientists were just kidding. Then, if you are kind, you gain no time affluence, life satisfaction, immune function, longevity, business success, popularity, self-esteem, or sense of belonging. Would you still be interested? I hope so, because the greatest reward of being kind is precisely being kind: All the rest is simply extra. Kindness is its own reward, and if we look at further advantages we may miss the main one.<br><br> Now let me add another factor to the equation: beauty. Suppose you decide to give some time to enjoying beauty&#x2014;in whatever way you choose: being in a natural landscape, listening to music, reading a novel, seeing a play or a movie, or simply looking at a face. By definition, beauty is enjoyable. My experience as a psychotherapist tells me that many of us have a deficit of beauty&#x2014;because we are too busy, or we feel we do not deserve it, or we believe other things are more important. But suppose you find the time to enjoy beauty fully in the way that is best for you. Again, a research finding: One of the results is that you will have become a kinder person. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> Yes, beauty helps you become a better person. I remember once when, coming out of a concert by Angela Hewitt in Florence, I saw an elderly lady begging for money at the exit. People, inspired and in good spirits after hearing Bach, were streaming out at the end of the concert. The lady looked quite happy, so I could not resist asking her how was business. She was very satisfied with her earnings: great timing, and great location! Somehow the concert made people feel more charitable. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> And if you consider this observation a bit too anecdotal, there is plenty of research to corroborate it. For instance, people who engage in the arts are more eager to help, form stronger bonds, and feel a greater sense of community. Individuals who are immersed in nature, or just recall being in it, or see slides of beautiful natural landscapes, will be less interested in their own everyday concerns and more connected to other people. The sense of awe evoked by a mountain landscape or by a walk in the woods has the capacity to weaken social pressures and everyday anxieties, and thus empathy and social bonds come to the foreground. And yes, time affluence also increases. &#x201c;Captivation&#x201d;&#x2014;the rapt, continuous attention to beauty&#x2014;allows us to be more in touch with intimate feelings such as love and tenderness. To sum up: Enjoying beauty is the easiest way to be kind. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> In my own experience as a psychotherapist, kindness is central. When I see a person in therapy, I first ask myself, has she been treated with care, listened to with attention, valued as she deserves to be, encouraged in her projects, comforted in her pain? In other words, how much has this person been in touch, one way or another, with the living reality of kindness? This basic experience is at times absent&#x2014;alas too often&#x2014;and the lack has alarming consequences. What shape has this deficit taken: the wound of neglect, the poison of resentment, the prison of loneliness? Finally, I ask myself, where is the heart? How much is this person capable of caring, how much is she ready for gratitude, how open is she to love? (True, some people are just too yielding and soft, if not pathologically kind&#x2014;they need instead to cultivate grit, self-affirmation, and courage. So I wrote a companion book to this one: Your Inner Will&#x2014;Finding Personal Strength in Critical Times).<br><br> What is true in therapy is true in all paths of life. Kindness is a precious guide, and it can become part of anybody&#x2019;s work on himself. It can be easily learned and activated. Its qualities, such as warmth, gratitude, or trust, are urgently needed in our society. It makes much more sense than the folly of violence in all its forms. Kindness is the simplest way of coping with so many hurdles, of feeling better, of enjoying life. It is problem solver #1. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> Yet kindness may not be immediately visible or available. Often it is only a potential, or a fading memory, or a dream, or a desperate longing. However, it is there, because it is a basic yearning, and the original blueprint of what we are, as I hope to show in this book. In Tolstoy&#x2019;s story &#x201c;What Men Live By,&#x201d; a very poor shoemaker is going back home at the end of the day, his mind full of worry about how to support his family. On his way, in the middle of a snowstorm, he finds a naked man, alone in the night, and dying of cold. At first the shoemaker does not want to know, and moves on. Then he changes his mind, comes back, offers him his coat, and takes him to his home. His wife is hostile at first; then she, too, takes care of the man, whose name is Mikhail, and gives him hot soup. He stays on, always mysterious, always shy, and works for the shoemaker. Years go by, and one day, husband and wife hear his full story. Mikhail is a fallen angel, who was sent to earth by God to learn what men live by. He tells of how at first humans looked ugly and frightful to him. But everything changed the moment they did something kind: Then they became radiant and beautiful. At the end he has learned the lesson and is ready to go back: Love and solidarity are what humans live by, what we are best and happiest at.<br><br> What inspired Tolstoy is now discovered increasingly in many fields of science. In the past ten years, since the first edition of this book, research on kindness and related subjects has greatly expanded. Without even trying to be exhaustive, let me just give a few notable examples: &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br><i>Chimpanzees that support each other: </i>As the work of Frans de Waal has shown, chimpanzees share food, help when a companion is in need, protect the weak, and assist the sick (for instance, by bringing them a mouthful of water), at their own risk defend a weaker member from aggression, console the victims of assault, and reconcile after a fight. Seeing that altruistic attitudes do not belong to our species alone sheds new light on altruism, and gives kindness greater scope and deeper roots. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><i>Toddlers who help:</i> According to Michael Tomasello, children as young as eighteen months are capable of spontaneous and disinterested altruism. When they see an experimenter trying to pick up a dropped peg, they will fetch it for him without being asked; if the &#x201c;clumsy&#x201d; experimenter does not succeed in piling up blocks, the toddler will do it for him, and will open a cabinet when he sees the experimenter struggling to put some books in it. According to Tomasello, this uniquely human capacity to understand another&#x2019;s intention and to cooperate with him (&#x201c;shared intentionality&#x201d;) is a prime factor of our evolution.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Primitives&#x201d; who assist their neighbors in need:</i> In the surprising new science of bio-archaeology increasing evidence shows that people with grave and incapacitating diseases were able to reach mature age: This was possible only through the assistance of others. For instance, as Lorna Tilley and Marc Oxenham have documented, a young adolescent in Vietnam four thousand years ago became paralyzed from the waist down, had fused vertebrae and weak bones, and he could not have survived by himself. He was assisted over several years, with no material benefits for his community. There are at least thirty such known cases. Caring for the sick and disabled, even though it does not offer any apparent benefit, is as old as humanity.<br><br><i>Brains hardwired for altruism: </i>Many neuroscience studies show that our brain has inbuilt capabilities for resonating with other people&#x2019;s pains and joys. Cooperation is intrinsically rewarding. Giving a gift will make the brain happy just as much as receiving it. According to Jaak Panksepp, the innate brain system of CARE is specifically devoted to nurturing and affection. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br><i> Parents who feed one another&#x2019;s children: </i>We share &#x201c;cooperative breeding&#x201d; with some other mammal and bird species: I will feed your kids and you will feed mine. When our ancestors moved from life in the trees to a savanna habitat a few million years ago, food became more scarce, existence more precarious. So mothers invented a more practical way of feeding their offspring. According to anthropologists Carel van Schaik and Judith Burkart, this was a major impulse in our evolution for developing language, intelligence, and altruism. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> <i>Economists who include kindness:</i> A growing number of economists are moving away from the conception of &#x201c;rational economy&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, the idea that the economy is based solely on rational selfishness, that each one of us is vehemently and consistently acting for his or her own well-being only. According to Amartya Sen the purely rational human being is a &#x201c;social moron.&#x201d; The factors that motivate us are also solidarity, mutual aid, donations and gifts, unpaid work, the cooperative spirit, and belongingness.<br><br> I could go on and on. Suffice it to say that how we&nbsp;see&nbsp;ourselves as a species, how we perceive what it is to be human, shapes our view of who we are. The dog-eat-dog paradigm, which has for a long time dominated much of our scientific tradition, the media, and the common view, is fading, while a fuller understanding is on the rise: Yes, we are selfish and competitive, but that is not the whole story.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scenario is not always so clear-cut. Years ago, after I had written the first three chapters of this book, I decided to send them to my agent in New York. I wanted to give her an idea of my new enterprise. I sent the e-mail on the morning of September 11, 2001, Italian time, the night before in New York. My agent would find it first thing in the morning. But that day a tragedy shook the world. My e-mail was the last thing my agent, working a few miles from the Twin Towers, would attend to. As I heard the news, after the first reactions of horror and dismay, I also thought about the chapters I had sent. Now they seemed so puny, so lightweight. Violence had triumphed.

With an introduction by Stephen King. <br></b><br>Death is reporter Jack McEvoy's beat: his calling, his obsession. But this time, death brings McEvoy the story he never wanted to write--and the mystery he desperately needs to solve. A serial killer of unprecedented savagery and cunning is at large. His targets: homicide cops, each haunted by a murder case he couldn't crack. The killer's calling card: a quotation from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. His latest victim is McEvoy's own brother. And his last...may be McEvoy himself.<br><strong><br></strong> <br><br></p><p>Jack McEvoy is a Denver crime reporter with the stickiest assignment of his career. His twin brother, homicide detective Sean McEvoy, was found dead in his car from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head--an Edgar Allen Poe quote smeared on the windshield. Jack is going to write the story. The problem is that Jack doesn't believe that his brother killed himself, and the more information he uncovers, the more it looks like Sean's death was the work of a serial killer. Jack's research turns up similar cases in cities across the country, and within days, he's sucked into an intense FBI investigation of an Internet pedophile who may also be a cop killer nicknamed the Poet. It's only a matter of time before the Poet kills again, and as Jack and the FBI team struggle to stay ahead of him, the killer moves in, dangerously close.<p> In a break from his Harry Bosch novels--including <i>The Concrete Blonde</i> and <i>The Last Coyote</i>--Edgar-winning novelist Michael Connelly creates a new hero who is a lot greener but no less believable. <i>The Poet</i> will keep readers holding their breath until the very end: the characters are multilayered, the plot compelling, and the denouement a true surprise. Connelly fans will not be disappointed. <i>--Mara Friedman</i></p>Jack McEvoy specializes in death. As a crime reporter for the Rocky Mountain News, he has seen every kind of murder. But his professional bravado doesn&#39;t lessen the brutal shock of learning that his only brother is dead, a suicide. Jack&#39;s brother was a homicide detective, and he had been depressed about a recent murder case, a hideously grisly one, that he&#39;d been unable to solve. McEvoy decides that the best way to exorcise his grief is by writing a feature on police suicides. But when he begins his research, he quickly arrives at a stunning revelation. Following his leads, protecting his sources, muscling his way inside a federal investigation, Jack grabs hold of what is clearly the story of a lifetime. He also knows that in taking on the story, he&#39;s making himself the most visible target for a murderer who has eluded the greatest investigators alive.</p><h2>PERFECT</h2><p>Lovely Hillary Spencer, overcoming a turbulent childhood, finds romance with the man of her dreams in a most unlikely place</p><p>Convicted of murdering his wife, film director Zachary Benedict is driven to a desperate act.

The conflagration of her title is the Second World War. In war-torn Asia and stricken Europe, men and women, still young but veterans of harsh experience, must reinvent their lives and expectations, and learn, from their past, to dream again. Some will fulfill their destinies, others will falter. At the center of the story, Aldred Leith, a brave and brilliant soldier, finds that survival and worldly achievement are not enough. Helen Driscoll, a young girl living in occupied Japan and tending her dying brother, falls in love, and in the process discovers herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the looming shadow of world enmities resumed, and of Asia's coming centrality in world affairs, a man and a woman seek to recover self-reliance, balance, and tenderness, struggling to reclaim their humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The Great Fire</i> is the winner of the 2003 National Book Award for Fiction.</p><p>The year is 1947. The great fire of the Second World War has convulsed Europe and Asia. In its wake, Aldred Leith, an acclaimed hero of the conflict, has spent two years in China at work on an account of world-transforming change there. Son of a famed and sexually ruthless novelist, Leith begins to resist his own self-sufficiency nurtured by war. Peter Exley, another veteran and an art historian by training, is prosecuting war crimes committed by the Japanese. Both men have narrowly escaped death in battle, and Leith saved Exley's life. The men have maintained long-distance friendship in a postwar loneliness that haunts them both, and which has swallowed Exley whole. Now in their thirties, with their youth behind them and their world in ruins, both must invent the future and retrieve a private humanity.<br><br>Arriving in Occupied Japan to record the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima, Leith meets Benedict and Helen Driscoll, the Australian son and daughter of a tyrannical medical administrator. Benedict, at twenty, is doomed by a rare degenerative disease. Helen, still younger, is inseparable from her brother. Precocious, brilliant, sensitive, at home in the books they read together, these two have been, in Leith's words, delivered by literature. The young people capture Leith's sympathy; indeed, he finds himself struggling with his attraction to this girl whose feelings are as intense as his own and from whom he will soon be fatefully parted.<br><br>A deeply observed story of love and separation, of disillusion and recovered humanity, <i>The Great Fire</i> marks the much-awaited return to fiction of an author whose novel <i>The Transit of Venus</i> won the National Book Critics Circle Award and, twenty years after its publication, is considered a modern classic.<br><br><b>Shirley Hazzard</b> was born in Australia, and in early years traveled the world with her parents due to their diplomatic postings.

He lavishly uses well-chosen, high-quality color photos, drawings, and plans. Two pages of simplified time lines put the major events of the book in clear chronological perspective. The 14 chapters range from "Jerusalem before the Israelites" and "How David Conquered Jerusalem" to "Herodian Jerusalem" and "Modern and Crusader Jerusalem." Shanks writes in an informal style and keeps the archaeology relatively simple. Although he incorporates the latest research, he does not introduce anything new. His work is an informative coffee-table book for the educated public; students in the field will find it an interesting, albeit expensive, picture book and summary of the highlights of Jerusalem's archaeology.<br><i>Eugene O. Bowser, Univ. of Northern Colorado, Greeley</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although no one knows the exact date of Jerusalem's founding, 1996 has been designated as its 3,000th anniversary. Shanks, the editor of <i>Biblical Archaeology Review</i>, offers a great anniversary present in the form of this impressive book. It begins with the remains of a house from the Bronze Age and takes readers on an archaeological tour that ends with the Ottoman period. And what a tour it is! Discover Jesus' tomb, Solomon's temple, and the palaces of Herod, just to name a few stops along the way. Shanks is able to pinpoint important finds and wrap them with history while, at the same time, introducing readers to the scientific techniques that make these finds possible. Matching the excellent text are numerous photographs and illustrations that capture both the mystery of this holiest of cities and its surprising everydayness. Jerusalem is a place where people have lived, dreamed, and died for a very long time, and this book offers fitting celebration of that fact. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men</h2><p>In a provocative and controversial study, the author of Who Stole Feminism refutes the claims of Reviving Ophelia to argue that boys have become the primary victims of American society, showing how boys&#39; weaknesses are aggravated by anti-boy prejudices and offering constructive suggestions on how to help young males.</p><p>The author of the provocative bestseller <i>Who Stole Feminism?</i> returns with an equally eye-opening follow-up. "It's a bad time to be a boy in America," writes Christina Hoff Sommers. Boys are less likely than girls to go to college or do their homework. They're more likely to cheat on tests, wind up in detention, or drop out of school. Yet it's "the myth of the fragile girl," according to Sommers, that has received the lion's share of attention recently, in hot-selling books like Mary Pipher's <i>Reviving Ophelia</i>. When boys are discussed at all, it's in the context of how to modify their antisocial behavior--i.e., how to make them more like girls. <blockquote>This book tells the story of how it has become fashionable to attribute pathology to millions of healthy male children. It is a story of how we are turning against boys and forgetting a simple truth: that the energy, competitiveness, and corporal daring of normal, decent males is responsible for much of what is right in the world. No one denies that boys' aggressive tendencies must be checked and channeled in constructive ways. Boys need discipline, respect, and moral guidance. Boys need love and tolerant understanding. They do not need to be pathologized. </blockquote> Sommers eviscerates feminist scholarship by Harvard's Carol Gilligan, the American Association of University Women, and others. Hers is feisty, muscular prose and fans of <i>Who Stole Feminism?</i> will delight in it. "There have always been societies that favored boys over girls," she writes. "Ours may be the first to deliberately throw the gender switch. If we continue on our present course, boys will, indeed, be tomorrow's second sex." That rhetoric may err on the side of alarmism, but Sommers' ideas are full of common sense. She essentially urges parents and educators to let boys be boys, even though their "very masculinity turns out to be politically incorrect." <i>The War on Boys</i> is sure to set off a fiery controversy, just as Sommers' previous book did--but it should also find a big audience of readers who become fans. <i>--John J.

Ojito has taught journalism at New York University, Columbia University, and the University of Miami. She writes for <i>The New York Times</i> from Miami.Adult/High School&#x2013;For her first 16 years, Ojito was torn between loyalty to the Cuban Revolution and the desire of her parents to leave the country. At school, she learned to be a good Revolutionary child. Extensive dossiers were kept on each student and family; ideological zeal was essential when one's future was controlled by the state. In the neighborhood, block captains tried to force attendance at political assemblies. The girl's parents simply wanted the state to stop interfering in their personal lives. They worked hard to obtain illegal extras&#x2013;including adequate food. In 1980, despite Ojito's ambivalence, the family left in the Mariel boat lift, a five-month exodus during which more than 125,000 Cubans arrived in Florida on small, overcrowded craft. The book alternates between the author's memoir and the stories of others whose actions influenced the boat lift, among them a Cuban American negotiating secretly for the release of Cuban political prisoners and the captain of the <i>Ma�ana</i>, which carried the Ojitos to Florida. The author gives a thoroughly researched account of events before, during, and after they left. Sometimes the narrative bogs down with unnecessary details. The strongest parts, with the most appeal for teens, are about growing up in Cuba, the warmth of family and friends, and the sudden departure and difficult trip into exile. Ojito's voice is honest throughout. She is critical of both governments and initially unimpressed by American culture. Above all, she advocates for the Marielitos, scorned as criminal scum by Castro and white Floridians alike.<i>&#x2013;Sandy Freund, Richard Byrd Library, Fairfax County, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Out of Our Heads</i>, he restates and reexamines the problem of consciousness, and then proposes a startling solution: Do away with the two hundred-year-old paradigm that places consciousness within the confines of the brain.&nbsp;Our culture is obsessed with the brain&#x2014;how it perceives; how it remembers; how it determines our intelligence, our morality, our likes and our dislikes. It&#x2019;s widely believed that consciousness itself, that Holy Grail of science and philosophy, will soon be given a neural explanation. And yet, after decades of research, only one proposition about how the brain makes us conscious&#x2014;how it gives rise to sensation, feeling, and subjectivity&#x2014;has emerged unchallenged: We don&#x2019;t have a clue.&nbsp;In this inventive work, No� suggests that rather than being something that happens inside us, consciousness is something we do. Debunking an outmoded philosophy that holds the scientific study of consciousness captive, <i>Out of Our Heads</i> is a fresh attempt at understanding our minds and how we interact with the world around us.</p><p>Alva No� is a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is also a member of the Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences. His previous book, <i>Action in Perception</i>, was published in 2004.<p>1 AN ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>The human body is the best picture of the human soul.</p> <p>&#x2014;Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p>Contemporary research on consciousness in neuroscience rests on unquestioned but highly questionable foundations. Human nature is no less mysterious now than it was a hundred years ago. If we are to understand our human nature, we need to make a fresh start. In this first chapter I lay out the basic challenge.</p> <p>Consciousness Is Like Money</p> <p>Stop and notice that you can believe in consciousness&#x2014;appreciate the fact that we feel and think and that the world shows up for us&#x2014;without believing that there is a place, or a moment in time, when and where consciousness happens or comes to be inside of us. As a comparison, consider that there&#x2019;s nothing about this piece of paper in my hand, taken in isolation, that makes it one dollar. It would be ludicrous to search for the physical or molecular correlates of its monetary value. The monetary value, after all, is not intrinsic to the piece of paper itself, but depends on the existence of practices and conventions and institutions. The marks or francs or pesos or lire in your wallet didn&#x2019;t change physically when, from one day to the next, they ceased to be legal tender. The change was as real as it gets, but it wasn&#x2019;t a physical change in the money.</p> <p>Maybe consciousness is like money. Here&#x2019;s a possibility: my consciousness now&#x2014;with all its particular quality for me now&#x2014; depends not only on what is happening in my brain but also on my history and my current position in and interaction with the wider world. It is striking that the majority of scientists working on consciousness don&#x2019;t even notice there is an overlooked theoretical possibility here. They tend to think that consciousness, whatever its ultimate explanation, must be something that happens somewhere and sometime in the human brain, just as digestion must take place in the stomach.</p> <p>According to the now standard view, our conscious lives&#x2014;the fact that we think and feel and that a world shows up for us&#x2014;is achieved in us by the action of our brain. The brain produces images of the environment and manipulates those images in a process known as thought. The brain calculates and infers and eventually produces neural commands so that we act. We really are our brains, and our bodies are at most robotic tools at our brains&#x2019; disposal. The brain is sole author of what is in fact a grand illusion: that we inhabit a richly detailed and meaningful world, that we are the sorts of beings we think we are. What are we, then? If the truth be told, we are brains in vats on life support. Our skulls are the vats and our bodies the life-support systems that keep us going.</p> <p>Or so mainstream neuroscience, and writers of science fiction, would have it. Is my body a robot that my brain inhabits? Is the world a grand illusion? Is this really an intelligible conception of ourselves?</p> <p>Are You Your Brain?</p> <p>The fundamental assumption of much work on the neuroscience of consciousness is that consciousness is, well, a neuroscientific phenomenon. It happens inside us, in the brain.</p> <p>All scientific theories rest on assumptions. It is important that these assumptions be true. In this book I will try to convince you that this starting assumption of consciousness research is badly mistaken. Consciousness does not happen in the brain. That&#x2019;s why we have been unable to come up with a good explanation of its neural basis.</p> <p>Francis Crick, the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning codiscoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule, has proposed (in a book titled The Astonishing Hypothesis) that "you, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules." With a flourish, he adds, "This hypothesis is so alien to the ideas of most people alive today that it can truly be called astonishing."</p> <p>What is striking about Crick&#x2019;s hypothesis is how astonishing it isn&#x2019;t. It isn&#x2019;t surprising to be told that there is a thing inside each of us that thinks and feels and wants and decides. This was the view of the seventeenth-century philosopher Ren� Descartes, who held that each of us is identical to an interior something whose essence is consciousness; each of us, really, is an internal res cogitans, or thinking thing. And this is the doctrine promulgated by many religious traditions. Of course, the religions, and Descartes himself, didn&#x2019;t teach that that thing inside us that thinks and feels is a part of our body, a bit of flesh, such as the brain. They supposed that it was something immaterial or spiritual, and so, in that sense, that it was something unnatural. How could mere matter&#x2014;mere meat&#x2014;achieve the powers of thought and feeling? Such a possibility boggles the mind. It is precisely on this point, and only on this point, really, that today&#x2019;s neurosci-entist breaks with tradition. As Patricia Churchland, a prominent philosopher of neuroscience, has written: "The weight of evidence now implies that it is the brain, rather than some non-physical stuff, that feels, thinks, decides."</p> <p>But what needs to be kept clearly in focus is that the neuro-scientists, in updating the traditional conception of ourselves in this way, have really only succeeded in replacing one mystery with another. At present, we have no better understanding of how "a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules" might give rise to consciousness than we understand how supernatural soul stuff might do the trick. Which is just to say that the you-are-your-brain idea is not so much a working hypothesis as it is the placeholder for one.</p> <p>Consciousness researchers in neuroscience like to think that they have broken with philosophy. They have left it behind and set off on the path of science. As Crick has written: "No longer need one spend time attempting . . . to endure the tedium of philosophers perpetually disagreeing with each other. Consciousness is now largely a scientific problem."</p> <p>Crick is right that the problem of consciousness is now a problem for science. But this doesn&#x2019;t mean that it is no longer a problem for philosophy. For one thing, the aims of philosophy and of science are not different: to achieve understanding of the problems that matter to us. But that&#x2019;s just the beginning: it is a mistake to think that the new neuroscience of consciousness has broken with philosophy or moved beyond it. In fact, as we have been discovering, Crick and other neuroscientists have simply taken a specific family of philosophical assumptions for granted, so much so that their own reliance on them has become all but invisible to themselves. But the fact of the reliance is everywhere in evidence. Its perturbing influence is felt in the seeming mandatoriness of what we can think of as a kind of "gastric juices" conception of consciousness&#x2014;that is, the idea that consciousness happens in the head the way digestion happens in the stomach. I mentioned before that it is overoptimistic to think of the new neuroscience of consciousness as in its infancy. Devel-opmentally, it would be more apt to characterize it as like a teenager. Like teenagers, neuroscience is in the grip of technology; it has a grandiose sense of its own abilities; and it is entirely lacking a sense of the history of what, for it, seems so new and exciting.</p> <p>A Really Astonishing Hypothesis</p> <p>It would be astonishing to learn that you are not your brain. All the more so to be told that the brain is not the thing inside of you that makes you conscious because, in fact, there is no thing inside of you that makes you conscious. It would then turn out that contemporary neuroscience has been in the thrall of a false dichotomy, as if the only alternative to the idea that the thing inside you that thinks and feels is immaterial and supernatural is the idea that the thing inside you that thinks and feels is a bit of your body. It would be astonishing to be told that we&#x2019;ve been thinking about consciousness the wrong way&#x2014;as something that happens in us, like digestion&#x2014;when we should be thinking about it as something we do, as a kind of living activity.</p> <p>In this book I advance this truly astonishing hypothesis: to understand consciousness in humans and animals, we must look not inward, into the recesses of our insides; rather, we need to look to the ways in which each of us, as a whole animal, carries on the processes of living in and with and in response to the world around us. The subject of experience is not a bit of your body. You are not your brain. The brain, rather, is part of what you are.</p> <p>A Note on Terminology, and the Thesis Restated</p> <p>In this book I use the term "consciousness" to mean, roughly, experience. And I think of experience, broadly, as encompassing thinking, feeling, and the fact that a world "shows up" for us in perception. Many writers have sought to define terms more narrowly than this. No doubt there are important distinctions that can and, for certain purposes at least, should be drawn. For example, a contrast is often made between thought or cognition, on the one hand, and sensation and feeling, or phenomenal experience, on the other. The contrast is between planning and carrying out an action, for example, and, say, experiencing the taste of licorice. When people draw this distinction it is usually because they think it is much easier to explain thought, say, than it is to explain the quality of our conscious episodes. For example, many theorists hold that thinking is a matter of computation and that we shed light on how brains think by comparing them with computers. As I discuss in Chapter 7, it is far from true that computers can think; moreover, I argue there, computers can&#x2019;t think largely for the same reason that brains can&#x2019;t. Meaningful thought arises only for the whole animal dynamically engaged with its environment, or so I contend. And indeed the same is true for the quality of our conscious episodes. The taste of licorice is not something that happens in our brains (although it is true that when we eat licorice, we do so by putting it in our mouths).</p> <p>Conscious states are typically states that I can talk about, that influence what I do, and so they are states that I can make use of in planning. For example, my dislike of the taste of licorice is something that informs my larger cognitive and behavioral life. Among other things, it will influence my shopping behavior. Such a state is available or accessible to thought and talk; it is sometimes said that this marks a distinctive sort of consciousness that the philosopher Ned Block has named access consciousness. The access consciousness of my feelings about licorice is one thing, however, and the experience of the licorice itself is another. The latter is an episode in what Block has called phenomenal consciousness, and the question of whether an episode is phenomenally conscious is, or so it seems, altogether different from the question of whether it is access conscious. To ask whether an episode is phenomenally conscious is to ask, in the philosopher Thomas Nagel&#x2019;s phrase, whether "there is something it is like to be" in that state. To ask whether it is access conscious is to ask whether the occurrence of the state influences what we say and do and want and plan and so on.</p> <p>Other distinctions abound. To be conscious, as opposed to being unconscious, is to be awake, aroused, alert, as opposed to being asleep or knocked out. In ordinary language, self-consciousness means a kind of interfering attentiveness to how others view oneself. In philosophy and cognitive science, self-consciousness means something different. Self-consciousness is that feature of experience by virtue of which our experiences are ours. Experiences have a kind of "mine"-ness that makes them, distinctively, our own, or so some thinkers have maintained. Freud famously hypothesized the importance of unconscious desires and wishes in explaining human psychology.</p> <p>Distinctions are useful, depending on your purposes. For my purposes, these distinctions don&#x2019;t matter in particular. When they do, I&#x2019;ll try to be careful to be clear about what I am referring to. The problem of consciousness, as I am thinking of it here, is that of understanding our nature as beings who think, who feel, and for whom a world shows up.</p> <p>Another terminological issue arises in connection with the words "mind" and "brain." The latter refers to a part of the body found in the head and connected up to a larger system known as the nervous system. It is widely believed that the brain and the larger nervous system of which it is a part play a special role in explaining our powers of mind (e.g., thought, memory, perception, emotion, and the like). Indeed, some scientists and philosophers think that the mind is the brain. Be that as it may, it is important to realize that no one holds that the concept of brain and the concept of mind are the same. To have a mind is, roughly, in my sense, to be conscious&#x2014;that is, to have experience and to be capable of thought, feeling, planning, etc. To have a brain, on the other hand, is to have a certain kind of bodily organ or part. Ordinary language is sometimes a bit confused about this, so we need to be careful. Being intelligent, for example, is said to be a matter of having brains.</p> <p>My central claim in this book is that to understand conscious-ness&#x2014;the fact that we think and feel and that a world shows up for us&#x2014;we need to look at a larger system of which the brain is only one element. Consciousness is not something the brain achieves on its own. Consciousness requires the joint operation of brain, body, and world. Indeed, consciousness is an achievement of the whole animal in its environmental context. I deny, in short, that you are your brain. But I don&#x2019;t deny that you have a brain. And I certainly don&#x2019;t deny that you have a mind. To have a mind, though, requires more than a brain. Brains don&#x2019;t have minds; people (and other animals) do.</p> <p>The Man with Two Brains</p> <p>I have always been a fan of Carl Reiner&#x2019;s hilarious movie The Man with Two Brains. Steve Martin plays the lead role, a brain surgeon named Dr. Hfuhruhurr who falls in love with a disembodied brain awaiting a transplant. This is the brain of the woman of his dreams. Now all he needs&#x2014;all she needs&#x2014;is a body! He sets about a villainous scheme to get his hands on the body of the beautiful and svelte Dolores Benedict (played by Kathleen Turner). The joke is that, unbeknownst to him, the self whose brain he loves has an eating disorder. By the time she recovers from the brain transplant, she&#x2019;s morbidly and unattractively obese. (He loves her anyway!)</p> <p>This is the stuff of science fiction. Pretty far-fetched, to be sure. The fact that we find it at all comprehensible, let alone compelling, shows that the "astonishing hypothesis" of the establishment neuroscientist now belongs to the conventional wisdom of the culture at large. We think of ourselves&#x2014;or find it easy to take seriously the idea of ourselves&#x2014;as dependent on our brains in a special sort of way, very different from the way we depend on our hearts, say. You gotta have heart, yes. But it is the brain, with its distinctive neuronal snap, crackle, and pop, that is our ground. We inhere in our brains. What makes us the kind of thing we are&#x2014;beings who can feel and reason and think and see&#x2014;is accomplished in our bodies by our brains.</p> <p>I ask again: Is this a plausible conception of ourselves? Reiner&#x2019;s movie casts an interesting light on this question. The film itself needs to present us with communication betwe...</p></p><h2>Stars! Stars!

The diaphanous poetry and the radiant, imprecise illustrations complement one another, but Barner stumbles in his delivery of quantitative information, which seems misplaced in this exercise. While the casual main text introduces the planets and pictures some fanciful stellar groupings (which appear to be based on the Hare, Whale and Little Fox constellations), a glossary of astronomical terms declares, There are 88 constellations in the sky and The Sun has been burning for about 5 billion years.

The first book to focus solely on the life and work of the man responsible for some of the most memorable rock anthems of our generation. Tom and Paul conducted a series of in-depth discussions about Tom&#x2019;s career, with special focus on his songwriting. The conversations are reprinted here with little or no editorial comment and represent a unique perspective on Tom&#x2019;s entire career.</p><p>Every so often someone like Tom Petty comes along and proves Leo Durocher wrong: nice guys don't always finish last. One of rock's most consistent songwriters and performers of the past 30 years, Petty sat for interviews with author and songwriter Zollo between 2004 and 2005, chronicling his career from his youth in Gainesville, FL, through success with his backing group the Heartbreakers, side trips as a solo artist, and as one-fifth of the ultimate supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys, right up to the present day. The Q&amp;A format is ideal for showcasing Petty's likable personality, and his passion for the music he creates is palpable. Zollo, a longtime fan, comes well prepared with knowledgeable and insightful questions that spur Petty's detailed recollections. Especially good is the book's second part: a discussion of nearly every song that Petty has written, recounted simply enough to engage lay readers but with enough on the nuts and bolts of songwriting to serve as an excellent primer for budding tunesmiths. Fans will be in Petty heaven; casual listeners will have a new appreciation for the artist and his music.

Tour.</p><p>This novel--the basis for the critically acclaimed 1998 film <i>Gods and Monsters</i>--re-creates the last days of film director James Whale, who was found dead in his swimming pool, an apparent suicide, in 1957. Bram offers sharp insights into the darkly comic sensibility that infuses Whale's two most famous films, <i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>, as memories of an impoverished English childhood, the trenches of World War I, and Hollywood studios compete for space in a mind whose defenses have been weakened by a stroke. Written in the fluid present tense of a cinematic treatment, <i>Father of Frankenstein</i> is a powerful evocation of an era before Hollywood celebrities could proclaim anything but domestic heterosexuality to the outside world.In this ingeniously imagined novel, Bram (Hold Tight) makes fiction out of the aged expatriate British filmmaker James Whale's last days. Whale, living in Hollywood and recovering from a minor stroke, finds life grotesquely refracted through his greatest creation, Frankenstein starring Boris Karloff, and its campy sequel, The Bride of Frankenstein. His mind is a cutting room-floor jumble of olfactory hallucinations, nightmares and flashbacks to his working-class childhood, the sets of his horror movies and the gore-muddied trenches of WWI. Meanwhile, like unwitting furies, a sycophantic film student and Whale's ex-Marine gardener, Clay Boone, churn up his past and impel him to scheme a suitable grand finale for himself. In a wickedly disconcerting series of scenes, Whale directs a mad plot around the short-fused Clay, who, attracted by Whale's old Hollywood glamour but creeped out by his homosexuality, vaguely wants to extract the experience of a lifetime out of the famous figure?"combat, a love affair, a harrowing adventure, even a crime." With amusing cameos by Elsa Lanchester, Greta Garbo and George Cukor, Bram cleverly mines his material's potential from nostalgia and comedy to the grimmer secrets of carnal and charnel knowledge. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sonic The Hedgehog Archives 14</h2><p>Victory!

Jessop detailed the story of her harrowing flight and the shocking conditions that sparked it in her 2007 memoir, <i>Escape</i>. Reveling in her newfound identity as a bestselling author, a devoted mom, and a loving companion to the wonderful man in her life, Jessop thought she had put her past firmly behind her.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on April 3, 2008, it came roaring back in full view of millions of television viewers across America. On that date, the state of Texas, acting on a tip from a young girl who&#x2019;d called a hotline alleging abuse, staged a surprise raid on the Yearning for Zion Ranch, a sprawling, 1700-acre compound near Eldorado, Texas, to which the jailed&nbsp; FLDS&nbsp; &#x201c;prophet&#x201d; Warren Jeffs had relocated his sect&#x2019;s most &#x201c;worthy&#x201d; members three years earlier. The ranch was being run by Merril Jessop, Carolyn&#x2019;s ex-husband and one of the cult&#x2019;s most powerful leaders. As a mesmerized nation watched the crisis unfold, Jessop once more was drawn into the fray, this time as an expert called upon to help authorities understand the customs and beliefs of the extremist religious sect with which they were dealing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Triumph</i>, Jessop tells the real, and even more harrowing, story behind the raid and sets the public straight on much of the damaging misinformation that flooded the media in its aftermath. She recounts the setbacks (the tragic decision of the Supreme Court of Texas to allow the children in state custody to return to their parents) as well as the successes (the fact that evidence seized in the raid is the basis for the string of criminal trials of FLDS leaders that began in October 2009 and will continue throughout 2010), all while weaving in details of her own life since the publication of her first book. These include her budding role as a social critic and her struggle to make peace with her eldest daughter&#x2019;s heartbreaking decision to return to the cult.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book&#x2019;s second half, Jessop shares with readers the sources of the strength that allowed her not only to survive and eventually break free of FLDS mind control, but also to flourish in her new life. The tools of her transformation range from powerful female role models (grandmothers on both sides) to Curves fitness clubs (a secret indulgence that put her in touch with her body) to her college education (rare among FLDS women). With her characteristic honesty and steadfast sense of justice, Jessop, a trained educator who taught elementary school for seven years, shares her strong opinions on such controversial topics as homeschooling and the need for the court system to hold &#x201c;deadbeat dads&#x201d; accountable. (Among Jessop&#x2019;s recent victories is a court decision that ordered her ex-husband to pay years of back child support.) An extraordinary woman who has overcome countless challenges and tragedies in her life, Jessop shows us in this book how, in spite of everything, she has triumphed&#x2014;and how you can, too, no matter what adversity you face.</p><p><b>Carolyn Jessop</b> was born into the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a group splintered from and renounced by the Mormon Church, and was married for seventeen years to one of its highest-ranking leaders. Her bestselling account of fleeing the FLDS, <i>Escape</i>, was published in 2007. She lives in West Jordan, Utah, with seven of her eight children.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Laura Palmer </b>is the author of <i>Shrapnel in the Heart</i> and has collaborated on six other books, the most recent being the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Escape</i>. She lives in New York City.The second memoir by former FLDS (Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints) member Carolyn Jessup focuses on her family&#39;s new life while continuing to explore many of the radical sect&#39;s controversial practices, including child abuse, the forced marriage of young girls, and home schooling. Just as Jessup&#39;s writing exhibits increasing maturity and a more sophisticated worldview, Ann Marie Lee&#39;s presentation has developed more depth and range since her narration of Jessup&#39;s first book, ESCAPE. Lee&#39;s crisp, clear tone conveys the confident and successful woman Jessup has become while allowing glimpses of the na�ve newcomer who is still adjusting to her new world. Although some incidents and issues from the earlier book are revisited, this is an intriguing account well worth a listen.

Among them are: Life Games (Alcoholic), Marital Games (The Frigid Woman), Sexual Games (Rapo), Party Games (Ain&#39;t it Awful), Underworld Games (Cops and Robbers), Consulting Room Games (I&#39;m only trying to help you), and Good Games (Homely Sage). Over two years on the American best-seller lists - a wise, original, witty and very sensible analysis of the &#39;game&#39; we play in order to live with one another - and with ourselves.</p><p>Dr. Eric Berne, as the originator of transactional analysis, has attained recognition for developing one of the most innovative approaches to modern psychotherapy. Discover how many of these &#34;secret games&#34; you play everyday of your life: Iwfy (If it weren&#39;t for you); Sweetheart; Threadbare; Harried; Alcoholic, and many more. A groundbreaking book that bores deep into the heart of all our relationships, GAMES PEOPLE PLAY is a classic that should be read again and again.Dr Berne&#39;s other works include &#39;The Structure and Dynamics of Organisations and Groups&#39; (1963), in which he discussed the application of transactional analysis to group dynamics; &#39;Principles of Group Treatment&#39; (1966); &#39;A Layman&#39;s Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis&#39; (1968); and &#39;What Do Yo Say After You Say Hello?&#39;, written shortly before his death in 1970.</p><h2>Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind</h2><p>What is the art of doing research that keeps soul in mind? The Wounded Researcher addresses (1) how an imaginal approach to the research process differentiates soul from the complex of psychology (2) how re-search is a vocation in which a topic chooses a researcher through his or her complexes (3) how engaging in transference dialogues helps to differentiate a researcher&#39;s complexes about the work from the soul of the work (4) how an alchemical hermeneutic method opens a space for the soul of the work (5) how this process and method have implications for how one writes down the soul of the work in writing up one&#39;s research and (6) how this imaginal approach to research that keeps soul in mind lays the foundations for an ethical epistemology.</p><p>ROBERT ROMANYSHYN, Ph.D., is on the core faculty at Pacifica Graduate Institute and has been a practicing psychotherapist for over 25 years. An affiliate member of the Inter-Regional Society of Jungian Analysts, he is the author of the following books: Mirror and Metaphor: Images and Stories of Psychological Life, Technology as Symptom and Dream, The Soul in Grief: Love, Death and Transformation, Ways of the Heart: Essays Toward an Imaginal Psychology, as well as numerous articles and essays in the fields of phenomenology and archetypal psychology.Soul work and academic research have been so split apart that both have been lamed -- soul psychology without intellectual respectability and scholarly research utterly irrelevant to the soul&#39;s concerns. Romanyshyn&#39;s book not only follows from all his earlier diligent explorations in the Western history of soul, but charts a course that joins the integrity of scholarly work with devotion to the soul&#39;s vital needs.

It was honored by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the Prophet in detail must read this book. <p>Muhammad (S) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurah (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (Paradise). (Al-Fath: 29) </p><p>The Prophet Muhammad (S) said: "The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land)."

They like it when storms bring down the electric lines in the village, leaving only broken bits of moonlight. Maybe they have a blood-memory of how it was before humans came and pushed them to the edges.<br> <br>By now Sabitri is usually asleep. The doctor has warned her that she needs to keep regular hours. Her heart isn&#x2019;t doing too well, and there&#x2019;s the blood pressure, too. Did she want to be bedridden and force-fed barley water? Did she want him to phone her daughter in Houston? Or Bipin Bihari Ghatak, her business manager who lived in Kolkata?<br> <br>No, she did not. Bela would rant, which was her default state when besieged by guilt, and Bipin Bihari, who was her oldest friend, would go silent with worry because he hadn&#x2019;t ever wanted Sabitri to move back to her ancestral village, so far from Kolkata, in her retirement. The savage lands, he termed it.<br> <br>She sets out pen and paper on the rickety dining table next to the kerosene lamp. She takes care not to wake Rekha, snoring on her coir mat in the alcove, because then she&#x2019;ll start scolding, the way longtime servants feel they&#x2019;re entitled to.<br> <br>The evening had started well, with her perched on the windowsill, watching sheets of rain blotting out the world. Gashes of lightning tore open the sky. Behind her Rekha wrung her hands. Let me shut the window. The rain will make all the bedclothes damp, the quilts will turn moldy, you&#x2019;ll get the pneumonia again, and then what will we do? But Sabitri refused. She loved the smell of night rain: wet earth, darkness, but also something else, nameless and a little frightening. When she was young, no one could keep her indoors at times like this. Even now, after she had grown brittle and creaky, the storm tugged at her insides. Ah, but Bipin Bihari should have seen her tonight!<br> <br>The phone rang. She wasn&#x2019;t going to pick it up. That&#x2019;s what she had bought that fancy expensive answering machine for. But then there was Bela&#x2019;s voice, ragged. She&#x2019;d been crying. What is it about children? An old need twisted in Sabitri&#x2019;s chest. Protect, protect. She lunged unwisely across the dark and banged her knee; pain shot down her leg like a fire.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; she called into the receiver, her voice sounding rough and angry, though she had not meant it to come out like that. Even now Bela had this effect on her.<br> <br>But Bela, preoccupied as she often was by her own drama, didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She rushed into her tale. Tara was thinking of dropping out of college, they had to stop her, she&#x2019;d only completed one semester, it would be the worst mistake of her life, the girl refused to listen to Bela, she never listened to anything her mother said nowadays.<br> <br>Sabitri hid her concern. Sympathy would only make Bela cry more.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear this.&#x201d; But how cold and unfeeling she sounded.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to write to her, Ma! You&#x2019;re the grandmother. If you stress the right things, point out the dangers of her stupid choice, perhaps it&#x2019;ll stop Tara from ruining her life!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sabitri wanted to remind Bela that she had tried all of the above with her. What good had it done? Besides, Tara had never even seen Sabitri. Every time Sabitri had asked Bela to bring her to India, Bela had an excuse ready. Almost as though she&#x2014;or maybe that husband of hers, that Sanjay&#x2014;felt Sabitri would be a bad influence.<br> <br>The years had taught Sabitri to keep such thoughts to herself. She said, instead, &#x201c;What made Tara want to drop out? She&#x2019;s such a good student.&#x201d;<br> <br>When she didn&#x2019;t receive an answer, she continued, &#x201c;Has Tara&#x2019;s father talked to her about this? There&#x2019;s a better chance of her listening to him than to me. Aren&#x2019;t they really close?&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence at the other end, more distressing than any amount of weeping. Then Bela said, &#x201c;Tara isn&#x2019;t talking to Sanjay at the moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something else was wrong, something worse than Tara aborting her studies, which in America, Sabitri had heard, could easily be picked up again. Sabitri suddenly felt much older than her sixty-seven years. She didn&#x2019;t have the strength to question Bela. What was the use of questions, anyway? Already she knew the most important thing: if her daughter&#x2014;proud, stubborn, so like herself&#x2014;had had anyone else to turn to, she would never have called Sabitri for help.<br> <br>She wrote down, carefully, the college dorm address that Bela dictated. She promised to take a rickshaw to the post office early tomorrow morning. She promised to send the letter by express delivery.<br> <br>Now she sits at the table that has been with her for decades, running her fingers over a gouge that Bela had hacked into the wood after they&#x2019;d had a fight. What can she write in her rusty English to change Tara&#x2019;s mind? She cannot even imagine her granddaughter&#x2019;s life, the whirlwind foreign world she lives in. All Sabitri has is a handful of photos. The child Tara in a costume, brandishing a broomstick, celebrating some odd American festival, the point of which Sabitri could not figure out. A teenage Tara at a special party called a prom, alien and glamorous in a strapless dress. Sabitri had been intimidated by her glittery cheekbones, the sophistication of her plucked eyebrows. How different from the photo she kept in her drawer, under her sari-blouses: baby Tara in Bela&#x2019;s arms, peering from under a woolly blue hood, a foggy orange bridge floating in the distance.<br> <br>That had been the first photo. Sabitri still remembers the pang she felt on receiving it because she had so wanted to be present at Tara&#x2019;s birth. But she hadn&#x2019;t been invited.<br> <br>Push away the past, that vessel in which all emotions curdle to regret. Start the letter.<br> <br><br> <br>Dearest Granddaughter Tara,<br> <br>I am sure you are surprised to receive this, since customarily we write to each other only to send Bijoya greetings. Your mother informs me that you do not wish to continue with college. I am very sorry to hear this and hope you will reconsider. Without education, a woman has little chance of standing on her own feet. She will be forced to watch from the sidelines while others enjoy the life she has dreamed about&#x2014;<br> <br>Wrong, wrong, all wrong. An entire hour wasted. She balls up the sheet and throws it to the floor.<br> <br>Dearest Granddaughter Tara,<br> <br>You do not know how lucky you are to be sent to college. So many families are too poor to be able to afford such an expense. It would be a criminal waste if you do not avail yourself of the opportunity life has given you.<br> <br>She hates what she has written, prissy, stilted, schoolmarmish. Tears it up. Her mind wanders, again, to the photos. Her favorite one, which she keeps on her dresser, is of Tara at the swimming pool, taken when she was nine. Dressed in a pink two-piece swimsuit, she balances on the edge of a board, about to leap into the water. Her face is filled with terror and elation.<br> <br>How well Sabitri knows that feeling.<br> <br><br> <br>Sabitri&#x2019;s own leap began, as so many things in Bengal do, with a platter of sweets. She has forgotten many things from that time&#x2014;just a few years after Independence; she was only seventeen then&#x2014;but the platter she remembers clearly: heavy, made of solid silver, with a sharp, raised edge that cut into her fingers as she carried it down a mud path behind her mother, Durga, who held a similar platter. Durga&#x2019;s back was bent. As she walked, the knobs of her backbone bobbed up and down under her worn sari-blouse. She was the hardest worker Sabitri knew. But for her, their household would have fallen apart long ago, for her father was the kind of man the world routinely took advantage of. Sabitri felt a churning inside her as she watched her mother, a mix of sadness and anger and love.<br> <br>The platters belonged to the Mittirs, the wealthiest family in the village. Their names were etched on the rims to discourage theft, or perhaps as a kind of proclamation. Mittir&#x2019;s wife Leelamoyi had ordered the sweets from Durga for a luncheon. The Mittirs had their own cook, a brahmin imported from Kolkata, but Durga&#x2019;s sweets, famous throughout the village, were far superior to anything he could have concocted. And Leelamoyi had to have the best.<br> <br>Sabitri hadn&#x2019;t wanted to come. Leelamoyi, who lived in Kolkata and only visited the village under duress during festival time, was known to have a sharp tongue, unpredictable moods, and an elevated notion of her own importance. She would surely remark on how tall Sabitri had grown and how, if her parents didn&#x2019;t act fast, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to marry her off. But there was no one else to help Durga. Sabitri&#x2019;s sister was too young. Her father was at the temple, where he was a part-time priest. And even if he had been home, he would have reminded them in his mild, surprised way that this wasn&#x2019;t a man&#x2019;s job. So here was Sabitri, sweating and irritated and trying not to step in cow dung.<br> <br>Inside the Mittir home it was cool and misty, the windows covered with damp rushes. Two maids wielded large palm-leaf fans. Leelamoyi, surrounded by a gaggle of gossips, had spread her considerable bulk over a flowery silken sofa. She must have been in an expansive mood, because she tasted the desserts, pronounced them satisfactory, and handed Durga a stack of rupees without counting them. Then she looked Sabitri up and down.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your daughter&#x2019;s name again?&#x201d; she asked Durga.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sabitri, Rani Ma.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha! Ambitious, aren&#x2019;t you, naming her after the mythic heroine who snatched her husband from the clutches of Death himself. Well, you&#x2019;d better find her a match fast, else she won&#x2019;t have a husband at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sabitri hid her fury and tugged at Durga&#x2019;s sari, trying to get her to leave, but Durga said, &#x201c;Sabi doesn&#x2019;t want to get married, Rani Ma. She wants to go to college. Wants to become a teacher. She&#x2019;s smart. Stood first in the matric exams in the Girls School. But we don&#x2019;t have the money.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sabitri&#x2019;s face burned. Go through life with your head held high, Durga had taught her. Why, then, would she humiliate herself&#x2014;and Sabitri&#x2014;by exposing to a rich, spoiled woman the tender dreams that Sabitri had entrusted to her? Dreams as impossible as sprouting wings. She would never confide in her mother again!<br> <br>Sabitri thinks: If only one could erase the years&#x2014;just long enough to say, I understand. But by the time she realized how much it had cost her mother to speak those words&#x2014;Sabitri was a mother herself then, and alone&#x2014;Durga was dead, beyond the reach of all apologies.<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Leelamoyi raised disbelieving eyebrows. Gold weighed down her arms. Just her bracelets would have paid for Sabitri&#x2019;s college twice over.<br> <br>Sometimes the unfairness of the world made Sabitri feel like she might burst. She pushed her way through the entourage toward the door.<br> <br>Behind her Leelamoyi spoke sharply. &#x201c;Girl, did I say you could leave?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sabitri considered disobedience, but an angry Leelamoyi could make their lives more miserable than they already were. She couldn&#x2019;t do that to her family. She stopped, though she did not turn around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell you what, Durga,&#x201d; Leelamoyi said, her voice indolent once more, &#x201c;if your impatient daughter is as smart as you claim, if she manages to get into a Kolkata college, I&#x2019;ll pay her fees and let her stay in our home while she studies.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sycophants jostled around Leelamoyi, jealously exclaiming at this goddesslike generosity, so much more than Sabitri deserved. Sabitri stood frozen in disbelief until Durga pulled her forward and told her to touch the Rani Ma&#x2019;s feet in thanks.<br> <br>The pure chill of marble against her forehead. Her thoughts whirling like a flock of startled birds. The drab dead-end wall of her future had just become a golden door. Thank you, she thought fervently, ashamed of her misjudgment. Leelamoyi&#x2019;s voice, booming from above, did sound like a goddess&#x2019;s. Sabitri could not decipher the words, though she heard the women titter in response.<br> <br><br> <br>A lifetime&#x2019;s worth of impatience, days slow as cattle grazing in a parched summer field. Then she was in front of the Mittirs&#x2019; Kolkata home, peering through the wrought-iron gate, clutching a painted tin suitcase in a sweaty hand. She had expected grandeur. Still, she was taken aback by the hugeness of the mansion, three stories tall, the shuttered windows like heavy-lidded eyes. Under an enormous portico gleamed a motorcar. The brick walls surrounding the compound were topped with broken glass to keep out intruders. A gatekeeper, thick-mustachioed as a bandit, banged his lathi on the paved driveway and shouted in his terrifying voice for her to move along. When she said that Leelamoyi had invited her to live here, he sneered in disbelief and tried to snatch away the letter of confirmation the Mittirs&#x2019; manager, Sarkar Moshai, had sent her.<br> <br>How the matter would have ended she did not know, but right then a young man emerged from the house. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s all the commotion?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>His shirt blazed in the sun, blinding her. She had never seen anything so white. Later she would ask him what kind of soap the Mittirs used. But his life had not taken him anywhere near the washing area of the house, so he did not know.<br> <br>She gathered her courage, pushed past the gatekeeper, and held out the note with desperate, trembling fingers. The young man gave it a brief glance and ordered the gateman to send her in to Sarkar Moshai. &#x201c;Make sure someone gives her food and water,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see she&#x2019;s exhausted?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Sabitri could thank him, he stepped into the waiting car.<br> <br>Later she would say, &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t even read that note, did you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I read your eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eyes can lie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yours,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Useless, these rambling memories. Focus on the letter, the one thing that might make a difference in the future.<br> <br>Granddaughter, people look down on a woman without education. She has few options. To survive, she is forced to put up with ill-treatment. She must depend on the kindness of strangers, an unsure thing. I do not want that for you&#x2014;<br> <br><br> <br>Even the most startling adventure, sooner or later, must become routine. So it was with Sabitri. Each morning she took the tram to the women&#x2019;s college, where most of her classes were held. For science and mathematics, she walked to a nearby men&#x2019;s college with a small group of girls. They sat in a nervous clump on a back bench because they had never had male classmates. The professors addressed only the men. Sabitri was mostly grateful to be ignored. The village school had not prepared her adequately; it was only with frantic effort that she managed to keep up.<br> <br>After classes, she studied in the library with two girls who were also from distant villages, sharing textbooks since none of them had enough money to buy them all. Sabitri received a monthly stipend from Sarkar Moshai, but it was barely enough to pay her fees and her tram fare, and she was too shy to ask for more. In between homework, they spoke of their families, how much they missed them. The girls stayed in a run-down women&#x2019;s hostel, six to a room. Once they went with Sabitri to see where she lived and stood staring at the mansion. Struck dumb by their amazement, Sabitri couldn&#x2019;t tell them how unhappy she was there.<br> <br>So many things run together in her head nowadays. But this she remembers: On the day of her arrival, Paro, Leelamoyi&#x2019;s favor...</p><h2>Why Did the Underwear Cross the Road?</h2><p>Determined to win his class&#39;s Good Deed Contest, Justin outdoes himself with his good intentions, which have a disconcerting and hilarious way of backfiring.

With disengagement and turnover on the rise, many managers are scratching their heads wondering what to do. It's not that we don't dream of being great managers, it's just that we haven't found a practical and efficient way to do it. Until now...<br><br>The fictional company in this remarkable book is grappling with real problems of high turnover and low morale so the managers begin to investigate what really drives the employees. What they discover is that the key to motivation isn't necessarily the promise of a bigger paycheck or title, but rather the fulfillment of crucial personal dreams. They also learn that people at every level need to be offered specific kinds of help and encouragement or our dreams will forever remain just dreams as we grow dissatisfied with our jobs and lives. Beginning with his important thought that a company can only become the-best-version-of-itself to the extent that its employees are becoming better-versions-of-themselves, Matthew Kelly explores the connection between the dreams we are chasing personally and the way we all engage at work. Taking on the growing problem of employee disengagement, Kelly explores the dynamic collaboration that is unleashed when people work together to achieve company objectives and personal dreams.<br><br> The power of <i>The Dream Manager</i> is that simply becoming aware of the concept will change the way you manage and relate to people instantly and forever. What's your dream?</p><p>Matthew Kelly is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Rhythm of Life</i> and twenty other books that have been published in more than twenty-five languages and have sold more than 15 million copies.A prolific personal development author shows how people can realize their dreams at work. With muscular clarity, he says the contract between worker and company should include an organized effort to help both become better versions of themselves. Companies can do their part by helping employees talk about goals, work on them, and find resources to achieve them. Though many listeners might prefer hearing the author�s voice, David Slavin brings his own commitment to the production. Wisely taking a supporting role to the author�s powerful words, Slavin allows Kelly�s ideas to shine without filters, without dramatic tinkering. The result is one of the purest and most powerful lessons on using the workplace to help people achieve self-actualization. T.W. 2008 Audies Finalist � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>London Under: The Secret History Beneath the Streets</h2><p><i>London Under</i> is a wonderful, atmospheric, imagina�tive, oozing short study of everything that goes on under London, from original springs and streams and Roman amphitheaters to Victorian sewers, gang hideouts, and modern tube stations. The depths below are hot, warmer than the surface, and this book tunnels down through the geological layers, meeting the creatures, real and fictional, that dwell in darkness&#x2014;rats and eels, mon�sters and ghosts. When the Underground&#x2019;s Metropolitan Line was opened in 1864, the guards asked for permission to grow beards to protect themselves against the sulfurous fumes, and named their engines after tyrants&#x2014;Czar, Kaiser, Mogul&#x2014;and even Pluto, god of the underworld. <br><br>To go under London is to penetrate history, to enter a hid�den world. As Ackroyd puts it, &#x201c;The vastness of the space, a second earth, elicits sensations of wonder and of terror. It partakes of myth and dream in equal measure.&#x201d;</p><p><b>PETER ACKROYD </b>is the author of <i>London: The Biography</i>, <i>Shakespeare: The Biography</i>, <i>Thames: The Biography</i>, and <i>Venice: Pure City</i>; acclaimed biographies of T. S. Eliot, Dickens, Blake, and Sir Thomas More; and several successful novels. He has won the Whitbread Book Award for Biography, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the Somerset Maugham Award, among others.Chapter 1<br><br>1. DARKNESS VISIBLE<br><br>Tread carefully over the pavements of London for you are treading on skin, a skein of stone that covers rivers and labyrinths, tunnels and chambers, streams and caverns, pipes and cables, springs and passages, crypts and sewers, creeping things that will never see the light of day.<br><br>A vast concourse of people, buried deep within the clay of the Eocene period, move beneath your feet in underground trains. Rooms and corridors have been created for the settlement of thousands of people in the event of calamity. You are also treading on the city of the past, all of its history from the prehistoric settlers to the present day packed within 24 feet of earthen fabric. The past is beneath us. It exists still as the companion of the present city. It is crowded. It has its own heat. A hundred feet beneath the ground the temperature hovers at 19� Celsius or 65� Fahrenheit. It was once a little cooler, but the heat of the electric trains has quickened it. The clay surrounding the tunnels has absorbed the warmth.<br><br>In a previous book I have explored the city above the surface; now I wish to descend and explore its depths, which are no less bewildering and no less exhilarating. Like the nerves within the human body, the underworld controls the life of the surface. Our activities are governed and sustained by materials and signals that emanate from beneath the ground; a pulse, an ebb, a flow, a signal, a light, or a run of water, will affect us. It is a shadow or replica of the city; like London itself it has developed organically with its own laws of growth and change. It was said of the Victorian Londoner, wrapped in fog and darkness, that he or she would not know the difference between the two worlds. The underworld is haphazard and wayward, with many abandoned passages and vast tunnels of brick leading nowhere. Beneath Piccadilly Circus is another great circus of myriad ways. The roads that converge on the Angel, Islington, have their counterparts beneath the surface.<br><br>It is an unknown world. It is not mapped in its entirety. It cannot be seen clearly or as a whole. There are maps of gas facilities, of telecommunications, of cables and of sewers; but they are not available for public perusal. The dangers of sabotage are considered to be too great. So the underworld is doubly unknowable. It is a sequestered and forbidden zone. It must be said, too, that there is little interest in this vast underworld. To fear is added indifference. What is not seen is not respected. The majority of pedestrians do not know or care that vast caverns exist beneath their feet; as long as they can see the sky, they are content.<br><br>Yet there may be monsters. The lower depths have been the object of superstition and of legend as long as there have been men and women to wonder. The minotaur, half man and half bull, lived in a labyrinth buried beneath the palace at Knossos in Crete. A dog with three heads, Cerberus, guarded the gates of the underworld in classical myth. The Egyptian god of the underworld, Anubis, was a man with the head of a jackal. The journey under ground prompted strange transformations. Anubis was also known as "the lord of the sacred land," with the world beneath the ground creating a spiritual as much as a material presence. The great writers of antiquity-Plato and Homer, Pliny and Herodotus-have described the underground worlds as places of dream and hallucination. Most of the great religions have created temples and shrines beneath the surface of the earth. Terror lingers in caverns and caves, where there may be subterranean rivers and fires. Sixteen thousand years ago the wandering people of Europe lived in or beside the entrances to caves; but they painted frescoes in the deeper and darker spaces of the caverns. The further downward you travel, the closer you come to the power.<br><br>Good and evil can be found side by side; enchantment and terror mingle. If the underworld can be understood as a place of fear and of danger, it can also be regarded as a place of safety. A subterranean space may be the object of attraction as well as of fear. Healing wells and places of worship lie beneath the streets. Like a mother, the lower deep may have a warm embrace. It is a haven from the outside world. It is a refuge from attack. In the darkness you cannot be seen. In the world wars of the last century it became a shelter for many thousands of people. The catacombs of Rome protected the early Christians. We can repeat the words of Mr. Mole to Mr. Badger from The Wind in the Willows (1908): "Once well underground, you know exactly where you are. Nothing can happen to you, and nothing can get at you." "That's exactly what I say," Mr. Badger replies. "There's no security, or peace and tranquillity, except underground." There has always been a London world beneath London. The author of Unknown London (1919), Walter George Bell, remarked that "I have climbed down more ladders to explore the buried town than I have toiled up City staircases." There is more below than there is above. It is stated in one London guidebook, "certain it is that none who knows London would deny that its treasures must be sought in its depths."<br><br>Yet malefactors of the past were also consigned beneath the surface. The medieval prison, or compter, was essentially a hole or pit in the ground. The deeper the prisoner was taken in the Tower of London, the more vile the durance. One of the least desirable places in London is the underground prison beside Clerkenwell Green known as the House of Detention. It consists of a dank and cold series of tunnels, with small cells and other rooms ranged alongside them; the structure is cruciform in shape, and was once the basement of a larger building. Much of its brickwork dates from the late eighteenth century, and it is imbued with generations of suffering. Its arches, leading to covered chambers, are of the same date. It was used as a gaol for more than 250 years, and did not finally close until 1877. It is believed by many people to be malignant and is popularly supposed to be haunted. It is appropriate, perhaps, that the shades of the dead should still wander beneath the earth. The river Styx, moving underground between the living and the dead, still flows.<br><br>The subterranean world can be a place of fantasy, therefore, where the ordinary conditions of living are turned upside down. In the nineteenth century it was seen as a sanctuary for criminals, for smugglers, and for what were known as "night wanderers"; the cellars and tunnels beneath the ground were described as "hidden haunts of vice" populated by "the wild tribes of London" or the "City Arabs." They were supposed to harbour a criminal "underworld" that emerged only at night. According to John Hollingshead, the author of Underground London (1862), the tunnels were "black and dangerous labyrinths for the innocent stranger."<br><br>But the underworld can also become a place of romance, where the childhood impulse to hide can be indulged to the wildest extent. The idea of secret passages, of mysterious entrances and exits, of retreat and concealment, possesses an incurable charm. Yet if we are not found, in the game of hide-and-seek, what then? What if we were left alone in the darkness, our companions gone into the light?<br><br>Underground chambers and tunnels have been formed, and found, over the centuries. There are extensive catacombs in Camden Town, beneath Camden Market, and prehistoric tunnels are to be found under Greenwich Park. A German traveller of the eighteenth century noted that "one third of the inhabitants of London live under ground"; by which he meant that the poor dwelled in the curious basements or "cellar dwellings" that were once so common in the city. They were entered by steps leading down from the street to a well "which was supposed to be closed at nightfall by a flap." The poor were thus consigned to the lowest level. The vagrants of London often lived under bridges and under arches, replicating the conditions beneath the ground.<br><br>The Adelphi arches, just south of the Strand, once offered a glimpse of an old underworld. The Adelphi itself was built in the 1770s upon a series of vaults and arches that were described as "a reminder of the Etruscan cloaca of old Rome." In the nineteenth century these became a haven for criminals and beggars. It was reported in the public prints that assassins were concealed "in the dark arches," such as those that make up Lower Robert Street, exploiting the passageways, tunnels, precipitous steps, sudden turnings and high- arched doorways. Horses did not like to venture through them. Stalactites hung from their roofs. Cows were stabled there, and passed their lives in darkness.<br><br>Lower Robert Street is still forbidding; it is one of the few underground streets in London, and of course has the reputation of being haunted by a murdered prostitute. In his Picturesque Sketches of London (1852) Thomas Miller described the region of shadows lying between the Strand and the Thames with "the black-browed arches that span right and left, before and behind, covering many a rood of ground on which the rain never beats, nor the sunbeams sleep, and at the entrance of which the wind only seems to howl and whine, as if afraid of venturing further into the darkness." They were another reminder of the London depths.<br>The geology of London is a clue to the labyrinth beneath. The city sits upon a bed of sand, gravel, clay and chalk that make up the London Basin. Deep beneath them are the rocks of the Palaeozoic period shaped hundreds of millions of years before; no one has reached them yet. Above them lie levels of ancient materials that are known as Gault clay and upper greensand. In turn they support broad bands of chalk laid down when the site of London lay below a vast sea. Upon the chalk rests the clay. London clay is thick, viscous, and malleable; it is a greenish blue colour, but in its upper reaches it is reddish brown. It was formed more than fifty million years ago. This is the material in which the underworld of London sits. It is the material ...</p><h2>The Canterbury Tales: Nine Tales and the General Prologue (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p>Here are tales told by members from all parts of English society of the 14th century, reflecting on life as they travel the road from Southwark to Canterbury.</p><p></p><h2>The Circle of Thanks</h2><p>Fourteen poems with themes of thanksgiving and appreciation of nature, based in part on traditional Native American songs and prayers.</p><p>Bruchac (Children of the Longhouse, p. 685, etc.) gathers 14 traditional Native American poems of appreciation and respect for nature's gifts.

A crescent-shaped turn-off had been leveled beside the first highway curve. Gilbert Dasein pulled his truck onto the gravel, stopped at a white barrier fence and looked down into the valley whose secrets he had come to expose.Two men already had died on this project, Dasein reminded himself. Accidents. <i>Natural</i> accidents. What was down there in that bowl of shadows inhabited by random lights? Was there an accident waiting for him?Dasein's back ached after the long drive up from Berkeley. He shut off the motor, stretched. A burning odor of hot oil permeated the cab. The union of truckbed and camper emitted creakings and poppings.The valley stretching out below him looked somehow different from what Dasein had expected. The sky around it was a ring of luminous blue full of sunset glow that spilled over into an upper belt of trees and rocks.There was a sense of quiet about the place, of an island sheltered from storms.<i>What did I expect the place to be?</i> Dasein wondered.He decided all the maps he'd studied, all the reports on Santaroga he'd read, had led him to believe he knew the valley.But maps were not the land. Reports weren't people.Dasein glanced at his wristwatch: almost seven. He felt reluctant to continue.Far off to the left across the valley, strips of green light glowed among trees. That was the area labeled "green-houses" on the map. A castellated block of milky white on an outcropping down to his right he identified as the Jaspers Cheese Cooperative. The yellow gleam of windows and moving lights around it spoke of busy activity.Dasein grew aware of insect sounds in the darkness around him, the swoop-humming of air through night-hawks' wings and, away in the distance, the mournful baying of hounds. The voice of the pack appeared to come from beyond the Co-op.He swallowed, thinking that the yellow windows suddenly were like baleful eyes peering into the valley's darker depths.Dasein shook his head, smiled. That was no way to think. Unprofessional. All the ominous nonsense muttered about Santaroga had to be put aside. A scientific investigation could not operate in that atmosphere. He turned on the cab's dome light, took his briefcase from the seat beside him. Gold lettering on the brown leather identified it: "Gilbert Dasein--Department of Psychology--University of California--Berkeley."In a battered folder from the case he began writing: "Arrived Santaroga Valley approximately 6:45 p.m. Setting is that of a prosperous farm community ..."Presently, he put case and folder aside.<i>Prosperous farm community</i>, he thought. How could he know it was prosperous? No--prosperity wasn't what he saw. That was something he knew from the reports.The real valley in front of him now conveyed a sense of waiting, of quietness punctuated by occasional tinklings of cowbells. He imagined husbands and wives down there after a day of work. What did they discuss now in their waiting darkness?What did Jenny Sorge discuss with her husband--provided she had a husband? It seemed impossible she'd still be single--lovely, nubile Jenny. It was more than a year since they'd last seen each other at the University.Dasein sighed. No escaping thoughts of Jenny--not here inSantaroga. Jenny contained part of Santaroga's mystery. She was an element of the Santaroga Barrier and a prime subject for his present investigation.Again, Dasein sighed. He wasn't fooling himself. He knew why he'd accepted this project. It wasn't the munificent sum those chain stores were paying the university for this study, nor the generous salary provided for himself.He had come because this was where Jenny lived.Dasein told himself he'd smile and act normal, <i>perfectly normal,</i> when he met her. He was here on business, a psychologist detached from his usual teaching duties to make a market study in Santaroga Valley.What was a perfectly normal way to act with Jenny, though? How did one achieve normalcy when encountering the paranormal?Jenny was a Santarogan--and the normalcy of this valley defied normal explanations.His mind went to the reports, "the known facts." All the folders of data, the collections of official pryings, the secondhand secrets which were the stock in a trade of the bureaucracy--all this really added up to a single "known fact" about Santaroga: There was something extraordinary at work here, something far more disturbing than any so-called market study had ever tackled before.Meyer Davidson, the soft looking, pink fleshed little man who'd presented himself as the agent of the investment corporation, the holding company behind the chain stores paying for this project, had put it in an angry nutshell at the first orientation meeting: "The whole thing about Santaroga boils down to this--Why were we forced to close our branches there? Why won't even <i>one</i> Santarogan trade with an outsider? That's what we want to know. What's this Santaroga Barrier which keeps us from doing business there?"Davidson wasn't as soft as he looked.Dasein started the truck, turned on his headlights, resumed his course down the winding grade.All the data was a single datum.Outsiders found no houses for rent or sale in this valley.Santaroga officials said they had no juvenile delinquency figures for the state's statistics.Servicemen from Santaroga always returned when they were discharged. In fact, no Santarogan had ever been known to move out of the valley.Why? Was it a two-way barrier?And the curious anomalies: The data had included a medical journal article by Jenny's uncle, Dr. Lawrence Piaget, reputedly the valley's leading physician. The article: "The Poison Oak Syndrome in Santaroga." Its substance: Santarogans had a remarkable susceptibility to allergens when forced to live away from their valley for extended periods. This was the chief reason for service rejection of Santaroga's youths.Data equaled datum.Santaroga reported no cases of mental illness or mental deficiency to the State Department of Mental Hygiene. No Santarogan could be found in a state mental hospital. (The psychiatrist who headed Dasein's university department, Dr. Chami Selador, found this fact "alarming.")Cigarette sales in Santaroga could be accounted for by transient purchasers.Santarogans manifested an iron resistance to national advertising. (An un-American symptom, according to Meyer Davidson.)No cheese, wines or beers made outside the valley could be marketed to Santarogans.All the valley's businesses, including the bank, were locally owned. They flatly rejected outside investment money.Santaroga had successfully resisted every "pork barrel" government project the politicians had offered. Their State Senator was from Porterville, ten miles behind Dasein and well outside the valley. Among the political figures Dasein had interviewed to lay the groundwork for his study, the State Senator was one of the few who didn't think Santarogans were "a pack of kooks, maybe religious nuts of some kind.""Look, Dr. Dasein," he'd said, "all this mystery crap about Santaroga is just that--crap."The Senator was a skinny, intense man with a shock of gray hair and red-veined eyes. Barstow was his name; one of the old California families.Barstow's opinion: "Santaroga's a last outpost of American individualism. They're Yankees, Down Easters living in California.Nothing mysterious about 'em at all. They don't ask special favors and they don't fan my ears with stupid questions. I wish all my constituents were as straightforward and honest."<i>One man's opinion,</i> Dasein thought.An isolated opinion.Dasein was down into the valley proper now. The two-lane road leveled into a passage through gigantic trees. This was the Avenue of the Giants winding between rows of <i>sequoia gigantea.</i>There were homes set back in the trees. The datum-data said some of these homes had been here since the gold rush. The scroll work of carpenter gothic lined their eaves. Many were three stories high, yellow lights in their windows.Dasein grew aware of an absence, a negative fact about the houses he saw: No television flicker, no cathode living rooms, no walls washed to skimmed-milk gray by the omnipresent tube.The road forked ahead of him. An arrow pointed left to "City Center" and two arrows directed him to the right to "The Santaroga House" and "Jaspers Cheese Co-op."Dasein turned right.His road wound upward beneath an arch: "Santaroga, The Town That Cheese Built." Presently, it emerged from the redwoods into an oak flat. The Co-op loomed gray white, bustling with lights and activity behind a chain fence on his right. Across the road to his left stood Dasein's first goal here, a long three-storey inn built in the rambling 1900 style with a porch its full length. Lines of multipaned windows (most dark) looked down onto a gravel parking area. The sign at the entrance read: "Santaroga House--Gold Rush Museum--Hours 9 a.m. to 5 p.m."Most of the cars nosed to a stone border parallel to the porch were well-kept older models. A few shiny new machines were parked in a second row as though standing aloof.Dasein parked beside a 1939 Chevrolet whose paint gleamed with a rich waxy gloss. Red-brown upholstery visible through the windows appeared to be hand-tailored leather.<i>Rich man's toy,</i> Dasein thought.He took his suitcase from the camper, turned to the inn.There was a smell of new mown lawn in the air and the sound of running water. It reminded Dasein of his childhood, his aunt's garden with the brook along the back. A strong sense of nostalgia gripped him.Abruptly, a discordant note intruded. From the upper floors of the inn came the raucous sound of a man and woman arguing, the man's voice brusk, the woman's with a strident fishwife qualify."I'm not staying in this godforsaken hole one more night," the woman screamed. "They don't want our money! They don't want us! You do what you want; I'm leaving!""Belle, stop it! You've ..."A window slammed. The argument dimmed to a muted screeching-mumbling.Dasein took a deep breath. The argument restored his perspective. Here were two more people with their noses against the Santaroga Barrier.Dasein strode along the gravel, up four steps to the porch and through swinging doors with windows frosted by scroll etching. He found himself in a high-ceilinged lobby, crystal chandeliers overhead. Dark wood paneling, heavily grained like ancient charts enclosed the space. A curved counter stretched across the corner to his right, an open door behind it from which came the sound of a switch-board. To the right of this counter was a wide opening through which he glimpsed a dining room--white tablecloths, crystal, silver. A western stagecoach was parked at his left behind brass posts supporting a maroon velvet rope with a "Do Not Touch" sign.Dasein stopped to study the coach. It smelled of dust and mildew. A framed card on the boot gave its history: "Used on the San Francisco-Santaroga route from 1868 to 1871." Below this card was a slightly larger frame enclosing a yellowed sheet of paper with a brass legend beside it: "A note from Black Bart, the Po-8 Highwayman." In sprawling script on the yellow paper it read:<i>"So here I've stood while wind and rain</i> <i>Have set the trees a-sobbin'</i> <i>And risked my life for that damned stage</i> <i>That wasn't worth the robbin'."</i>Dasein chuckled, shifted his briefcase to his left arm, crossed to the counter and rang the call bell.A bald, wrinkled stick of a man in a black suit appeared in the open doorway, stared at Dasein like a hawk ready to pounce. "Yes?""I'd like a room," Dasein said."What's your business?"Dasein stiffened at the abrupt challenge. "I'm tired," he said. "I want a night's sleep.""Passing through, I hope," the man grumbled. He shuffled to the counter, pushed a black registry ledger toward Dasein.Dasein took a pen from its holder beside the ledger, signed.The clerk produced a brass key on a brass tag, said: "You get two fifty-one next to that dang' couple from L.A. Don't blame me if they keep y' awake arguing." He slapped the key onto the counter. "That'll be ten dollars ... in advance.""I'm hungry," Dasein said, producing his wallet and paying. "Is the dining room open?" He accepted a receipt."Closes at nine," the clerk said."Is there a bellboy?""You look strong enough to carry your own bag." He pointed beyond Dasein. "Room's up them stairs, second floor."Dasein turned. There was an open area behind the stagecoach. Scattered through it were leather chairs, high wings and heavy arms, a few occupied by elderly men sitting, reading. Light came from heavy brass floor lamps with fringed shades. A carpeted stairway led upward beyond the chairs.It was a scene Dasein was to think of many times later as his first clue to the real nature of Santaroga. The effect was that of holding time securely in a bygone age.Vaguely troubled, Dasein said: "I'll check my room later. May I leave my bag here while I eat?""Leave it on the counter. No one'll bother it."Dasein put the case on the counter, caught the clerk studying him with a fixed stare."Something wrong?" Dasein asked."Nope."The clerk reached for the briefcase under Dasein's arm, butDasein stepped back, removed it from the questing fingers, met an angry stare."Hmmmph!" the clerk snorted. There was no mistaking his frustration. He'd wanted a look inside the briefcase.Inanely, Dasein said: "I ... uh, want to look over some papers while I'm eating." And he thought: <i>Why do I need to explain?</i>Feeling angry with himself, he turned, strode through the passage into the dining room. He found himself in a large square room, a single massive chandelier in the center, brass carriage lamps spaced around walls of dark wood paneling. The chairs at the round tables were heavy with substantial arms. A long teak bar stretched along the wall at his left, a wood-framed mirror behind it. Light glittered hypnotically from the central chandelier and glasses stacked beneath the mirror.The room swallowed sounds. Dasein felt he had walked into a sudden hush with people turning to look at him. Actually, his entrance went almost unnoticed.A white-coated bartender on duty for a scattering of customers at the bar glanced at him, went back to talking to a swarthy man hunched over a mug of beer.Family groups occupied about a dozen of the tables. There was a card game at a table near the bar. Two tables held lone women busy with their forks.There was a division of people in this room, Dasein felt. It was a matter of nervous tension contrasted with a calmness as substantial as the room itself. He decided he could pick out the transients--they appeared tired, more rumpled; their children were closer to rebellion.As he moved farther into the room, Dasein glimpsed himself in the bar mirror--fatigue lines on his sle...</p><h2>To See the Moon Again</h2><p><b><i>The first step to letting go of the past is forgiving it...</i></b><br><br>Every day of her life Julia Rich lives with the memory of a horrible accident she caused long ago.

As she neared Ivy Dale Lane, where she lived, she once again reminded herself of two things. First, that many other professors worldwide not only had endured what she was facing but had actually enjoyed it and, second, that most of her current colleagues would gladly trade places with her right now. Neither of these reminders, however, helped to settle her mind.</p><p>She slowed her Buick as she turned onto Ivy Dale, a narrow, tree-lined street less than a mile from the campus of Millard-Temple University, where she taught. At one time numbers of faculty members had lived here, but now only Julia and one other remained&#x2014;a French teacher named Dr. Boyer. He was an odd, nervous sort of man, a Charlie Chaplin look-alike, who never said &#x201c;hello&#x201d; to her, only a prim, tight-lipped &#x201c;<i>bonjour</i>,&#x201d; though more recently he had not spoken to her at all. She suspected that he resented her being granted a sabbatical ahead of him. Or maybe he avoided her because he felt sorry for her, as others now did.</p><p>As soon as her house came into view, she slowed even more. It was an old habit&#x2014;the initial sighting, then the intentional deferral of her arrival as she took it all in. It was a small stone house with the charm of a storybook cottage. She and Matthew had driven past it one day before they were married. &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;There, look at that one. I want to live there someday.&#x201d;</p><p>When it came up for sale a few years later, Matthew had arranged to buy it as a surprise for her. Those were the days when he was doing anything he could to make her happy, an enterprise he persisted in long after every effort had proved futile. Once they moved in and discovered the extent of the work it needed, it had lost some of its storybook charm, at least for Matthew, who did most of the labor himself. But Julia had loved it straight through the years of repairs and renovations. Even now there were times when she would be away from home and would suddenly think of the stone house on Ivy Dale and be flooded with something close to gladness. In many ways her house had taken the place of children in her life, the way some people&#x2019;s pets did.</p><p>She parked in the circular drive in front and took a few moments to let her eyes sweep the yard from one end to the other. Spring had come to South Carolina early this year, wet and mild. Daffodils, hyacinth, dogwoods, azaleas&#x2014;all had bloomed in a spectacle of color. And now the irises were opening, soon to be followed by peonies, lilies, roses.</p><p>She walked around to the back door to let herself in, then locked it behind her. The answering machine in the kitchen was blinking, so she stepped out of her shoes at the door, laid her briefcase on the table, and walked to the phone. She knew who it was, of course. Since last August, her sister, Pamela, had worried incessantly about Julia&#x2019;s living alone and had called daily to check up on her. Because she didn&#x2019;t work, Pamela had time on her hands, and because her children were both grown, she needed someone else to mother. It didn&#x2019;t matter that she was younger than Julia by five years. She had always had the manner of an overseer, even as a child.</p><p>If Julia wasn&#x2019;t home when she called, Pamela left a message, usually constructed around a warning of some kind: <i>Always check the backseat of your car before getting in, don&#x2019;t order with a credit card over the phone, wear flat shoes in case you need to run.</i> She often included reports of tragic outcomes for people she had heard about who failed to follow these rules.</p><p>Julia almost pressed the button to listen, but she stopped. She was bone-tired and mentally spent. She wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to hear her sister&#x2019;s voice reminding her that evil prowled the earth. She turned and went to her bedroom instead. She took off her skirt, removed her jewelry, pulled her sweater over her head, and took her time putting everything away in its place. From the hook on the back of the bathroom door, she took her housecoat, slipped it on, and snapped it up.</p><p>Even as she did these things, she was thinking of the hours ahead. Since it was the last Friday night of the school year, she had no papers to grade. The evening gaped before her, with no plans to fill it, which was part of the reason for her present unrest. By putting on her housecoat, she realized she had already decided not to take a walk, which was one way to spend an hour or so now that Daylight Saving Time was in effect.</p><p>But for now she had supper to think about. On her teaching days she often ate a substantial lunch in the faculty cafeteria on campus and only snacked in the evening. Today, however, she hadn&#x2019;t felt like walking over to the cafeteria, choosing her food, sitting at the same corner table with Marcy Kingsley, her only real friend among her colleagues. Today had been a day of reflection. She had stayed in her office between her morning and afternoon classes. When Marcy had stopped by to get her, she had begged off, claiming a headache.</p><p>She had bought a bag of pretzels from the vending machine and busied herself going through the bottom drawer of her desk, discarding entire folders of old papers and ditto masters. Ditto masters&#x2014;dozens and dozens of them, some handwritten. It was hard to believe she had hung on to such antiquities so long. Afterward she had run new copies of an exam, cleaned out the top desk drawer, dusted her bookshelves.</p><p>And then, because she still had a half hour left before her three o&#x2019;clock class, she had sat at her desk with her door cracked, listening to the graduate teaching assistants socializing in the hallway. They were as eager for summer as the undergrads. Not one of them had yet wished her well during the coming year. By now they had probably forgotten all about the announcement in the February faculty meeting, after which there had been a pattering of polite applause for the two professors chosen for sabbaticals&#x2014;Julia and Harry Tobias, who taught psychology.</p><p>Julia didn&#x2019;t fully understand the selection process, but she knew it was a committee decision and that the words &#x201c;having distinguished yourself by the length and quality of your service&#x201d; had been used by Dean Moorehead when he first informed her of the award privately. Though he didn&#x2019;t add the words &#x201c;and because of your recent personal difficulties,&#x201d; he might as well have, for Julia was certain a measure of pity had also figured into the committee&#x2019;s choice.</p><p>Though she had pretended to be pleased and honored, it was mostly shock she had felt. That, and the beginnings of worry as she tried to take in what it would mean to the comforting structure of her life to have a year off. Long ago she had resigned herself to the mischief of time, for though a year could pass swiftly, the days within that year could seem endless. And each day included a night.</p><p>Stepping into her bedroom slippers, she thought of all the nights like this she would have to fill in the coming year. She was struck with the urgent need to write up a list of projects she wanted to complete and places she wanted to visit. That would be one thing to do tonight.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>BACK in the kitchen, she opened the freezer. Earlier in the week she had put up a dish of leftovers, which she pulled out now and put in the microwave to defrost.</p><p>She looked again at the blinking light of the telephone, but walked past it into the living room&#x2014;a comfortable room, well decorated with an eclectic mix of fine old furniture and modern accessories. Above the stone hearth hung a large, colorful framed collage made of scraps of old road maps, travel brochures, and envelopes with canceled postage stamps. It was one of the few things Matthew had bought for the house that she liked. She made herself stop and look at it now, as she often did, to prove that she held no grudge against him, that her world was still intact.</p><p>She turned on the television and listened to the news for a minute, then lowered the volume and turned on the CD player. The sounds of Dvor�k filled the room.</p><p>She walked back to the bathroom to wash off her makeup. Glancing into the mirror above the sink, she saw a long purple smear on her chin. She rubbed at it with her index finger and got some of it off.</p><p>She suddenly remembered the folder of old ditto masters she had leafed through in her office that afternoon. The mark on her chin must have come from those. Purple ditto ink&#x2014;amazing that it could still be picked up and transferred after all those years of sitting in a folder.</p><p>As she stared at her face, it came to her that she must have had the purple streak on her chin when she met her afternoon class. Her ten students in Writing Fiction must have seen it. When she stepped off the dais to deliver her farewell remarks, they must have been reminded of all the old people they knew who went around with spots on their clothing and tufts of hair sticking out at funny angles.</p><p>At one point in her little speech, Julia had paused and looked toward the transom window above the door. Such an occasion called for a little drama, as it was no ordinary final day of class, at least not for her. &#x201c;Remember this,&#x201d; she had said when she resumed. &#x201c;Writers must be close observers of people.&#x201d; They must have wanted to laugh at that. &#x201c;And of places,&#x201d; she had added after another dramatic pause. &#x201c;Particularly your own native soil, into which you must keep digging deeper.&#x201d; She knew they would recognize the last part as a quotation from Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, the woman Julia considered the best Southern writer of all time.</p><p>Looking at her watch, she saw that the bell would ring in two minutes. Time now for the real news. Stepping a little closer to the students, she said, &#x201c;Some of you may have heard a rumor that I won&#x2019;t be teaching at Millard-Temple next year.&#x201d;</p><p>No dropped jaws, but she could see a sudden return of interest. All eyes were on Julia.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have been granted a sabbatical, which simply means I will get paid to read, to write, to travel, to do whatever I choose for a year.&#x201d; She glanced up at the transom window again and nodded slowly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an opportunity not everyone gets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You going on a cruise?&#x201d; Aaron Clements asked. This drew laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Julia said. &#x201c;Or maybe I&#x2019;ll travel in the States. Visit some of the big cities I&#x2019;ve never seen.&#x201d; It was impossible to think she had lived fifty-four years and never been to Chicago or New York City, had never really wanted to. &#x201c;Or maybe I&#x2019;ll just stay home and be lazy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Watch old movies and read and clean out a cupboard every now and then.&#x201d;</p><p>They smiled, though she could tell their thoughts were already drifting elsewhere. She hurried on. &#x201c;Others will cover my courses next year, and I&#x2019;ll return a year from this fall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;ll teach Southern Writers?&#x201d; someone said.</p><p>&#x201c;An adjunct from Clemson,&#x201d; Julia said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll like him. He&#x2019;s a Faulkner man.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell rang. The students looked uncertain, as if wondering whether it would be rude to gather their things and bolt for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, off with you,&#x201d; Julia said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you here again on Monday for your exam.&#x201d; She had already announced the essay topic. What she hadn&#x2019;t told them, of course, was that she wouldn&#x2019;t read the essays, wouldn&#x2019;t even skim the first pages, but would take them all home and gently place them in the trash can.</p><p>And the whole time they must have been sitting there thinking, <i>What </i>is<i> that on her face?</i> Maybe they thought it was a bruise. That would be better than if they thought it was a smudge she had failed to notice.</p><p>And the student who had come to see her in her office less than an hour ago&#x2014;she must have seen the purple mark, too.</p><p>Julia had been sitting at her desk after class, thinking about how much she would miss coming here for the next year. She loved her office&#x2014;her massive oak desk, the wooden file cabinet, the high ceiling, the window that faced the fountains. It pleased her to know it wouldn&#x2019;t be assigned to anyone else during her sabbatical. Everything could be kept in place. She imagined herself sneaking over at nighttime to sit here in the dark.</p><p>Turning to the window, she watched the students crossing the footbridge between Simmons Hall and the Snack Shop. Everyone walked differently on the last day of class. Every step said, <i>Let me out of here, I&#x2019;m dying for summer</i>. On the sidewalk outside her window, two girls stopped to talk, and one of them gave a whoop of laughter as they bent their heads over a cell phone.</p><p>And then there had been a light tap at her door. She turned and saw a form silhouetted through the large pane of frosted glass. &#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she called.</p><p>The door opened partway, and she saw a face. &#x201c;Dr. Rich?&#x201d;</p><p>Julia recognized her at once. &#x201c;Come in, Kelly,&#x201d; she said, standing.</p><p>The girl opened the door farther and stepped inside. Kelly Kovatch was one of the few bright lights in Julia&#x2019;s morning class of Creative Writing sophomores this semester. A tall, pretty girl, quiet and demure the way girls used to be.</p><p>&#x201c;Will you have a seat?&#x201d; Julia said, nodding toward the old library chair she used for student conferences. Julia sat back down at her desk and swung her chair around to face the girl.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay long,&#x201d; Kelly said. &#x201c;I need to be at work soon.&#x201d; She pushed her dark hair behind one ear. Unlike the disarray so many girls favored these days on the tops of their heads, hers was a neat, tidy hairstyle from an earlier era&#x2014;longer than a bob but not quite a pageboy. She took a deep breath and continued. &#x201c;I came to tell you something about the short story I wrote for your class. You probably don&#x2019;t remember which one was mine, but it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I remember. It was about the father and his teenage son, whose driving lesson was a fiasco.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Yes. That was it.&#x201d; She looked directly at Julia and swallowed. &#x201c;Well, I need to confess something. It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wasn&#x2019;t really my work.&#x201d;</p><p>She could have no way of knowing what effect her words would have. For a long moment Julia stopped breathing but never took her eyes off the girl. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; she asked at last.</p><p>Kelly sighed and shook her head. &#x201c;Well, I turned in that story for a class called <i>Creative</i> Writing, but I didn&#x2019;t really create it. The whole conversation in the garage really happened, almost verbatim. It was my own father and one of my brothers. And the part about the paint buckets and the garden hose&#x2014;that really happened, too. And the spare tire and the bag of flour and the scorched hot dogs&#x2014;those, too. I&#x2019;m ashamed to say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She trailed off and looked down at her hands, then added softly, &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I never even told them I was using them for my story. I just did it.&#x201d;</p><p>Julia was afraid the girl might be crying, but when she lifted her face, her eyes were dry, her voice steady. &#x201c;I keep remembering what you said before we ever started writing ...</p></p><h2>Daughter of Empire: My Life as a Mountbatten</h2><p><b>This magical memoir about a singular childhood in England and India by the daughter of Lord Louis and Edwina Mountbatten provides a privileged glimpse into the lives and loves of some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s leading figures.</b><br><br><b>A magical memoir about a singular childhood in England and India by the daughter of Lord Louis and Edwina Mountbatten</b><br> <br>Few families can boast of not one but two saints among their ancestors, a great-aunt who was the last tsarina of Russia, a father who was Grace Kelly&#x2019;s pinup, and a grandmother who was not only a princess but could also argue the finer points of naval law. Pamela Mountbatten entered a remarkable family when she was born at the very end of the Roaring Twenties.<br> <br>As the younger daughter of the glamorous heiress Edwina Ashley and Lord Louis Mountbatten, Pamela spent much of her early life with her sister, nannies, and servants&#x2014;and a menagerie that included, at different times, a bear, two wallabies, a mongoose, and a lion. Her parents each had lovers who lived openly with the family. The house was always full of guests like Sir Winston Churchill, No�l Coward, Douglas Fairbanks, and the Duchess of Windsor (who brought a cold cooked chicken as a hostess gift).<br> <br>When World War II broke out, Lord Mountbatten was in command of HMS <i>Kelly</i> before being appointed chief of Combined Operations, and Pamela and her sister were sent to live on Fifth Avenue in New York City with Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt. In 1947, her parents were appointed to be the last viceroy and vicereine of India and oversee the transfer of power to an independent Indian government. Amid the turmoil of political change, Pamela worked with student leaders, developed warm friendships with Gandhi and Nehru, and witnessed both the joy of Independence Day and its terrible aftermath. Soon afterwards, she was a bridesmaid in Princess Elizabeth&#x2019;s wedding to Prince Philip, and was a ladyin- waiting at the young princess&#x2019;s side when she learned her father had died and she was queen.<br> <br>Vivid and engaging, well-paced and superbly detailed, this witty, intimate memoir is an enchanting lens through which to view the early part of the twentieth century.</p><p>Pamela Hicks is the daughter of Lord Louis and Edwina Mountbatten. She was Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen both when she was a princess and following her coronation. In 1960 she married the internationally celebrated designer David Hicks. She is the author of <i>India Remembered</i> and lives in Oxfordshire.Daughter of Empire 1 <p></p> <br>My father could trace his roots back to the ninth century. Through forty-one generations, he was able to recount the lives of our ancestors&#x2014;royalists, rebels, and saints. He never tired of telling me that it was extremely rare for a family to be able to cite two canonized antecedents. &#x201c;The first,&#x201d; he would say proudly, &#x201c;goes way back to the thirteenth century. St. Elisabeth of Hungary was a gracious princess who secretly gave alms to the poor. Her husband didn&#x2019;t approve of this and, one morning, ordered her to remove the cover of her basket. And&#x201d;&#x2014;I loved the ending of this story&#x2014;&#x201c;her forbidden bread had miraculously turned into roses.<br> <br>&#x201c;The other was your great-aunt Ella, Grand Duchess Serge of Russia, who, following her husband&#x2019;s assassination, became a nun and worked tirelessly among the poor and sick of Moscow. In 1918, when she, the chief nun, three young princes, a grand duke, and a lady-in-waiting were thrown down a mine shaft by the Bolsheviks&#x2014;along with a few hand grenades for good measure&#x2014;witnesses heard her clear sweet voice singing &#x2018;Hail Gentle Light&#x2019; and other hymns of fortitude to her fellow victims. Before she died, she tore up her nun&#x2019;s veil to provide bandages for the princes&#x2019; wounds.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now known as St. Elisabeth of Romanova, my great-aunt is one of twelve modern saints preserved in sculpture above the West Door of Westminster Abbey. It was hard to keep track of my father&#x2019;s long line of relatives, but as he loved lists and charts and stories, he was always ready to bring them to life. For many generations his ancestors had been rulers of the Grand Duchy of Hesse in Germany, a landlocked territory far from the coast. It was his father, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, who changed all that and altered the course of the family&#x2019;s path. In 1868, at the tender age of fourteen, beset by dreams of a seafaring life, he surprised everyone by announcing that he was leaving home to set sail. In fact he was so determined to become part of the &#x201c;greatest navy in the world&#x201d; that he took British citizenship, eventually rising to the top job of First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet. He didn&#x2019;t cut off his ties with Europe completely, though, falling in love with his cousin Princess Victoria of Hesse, a sparky, independent-minded granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who was related to most of the royal courts in Europe. In those days it wasn&#x2019;t always an advantage to have family members scattered across Europe, and during the First World War his mother found herself on opposite sides to her brother and sister. Luckily, my father always said, while patriotism was intense, it never undermined strong family affections.<br> <br>My grandparents married in 1884 and lived variously in England, Germany, and Malta. My father, also Prince Louis of Battenberg but known as &#x201c;Dickie,&#x201d; was born in 1900, the youngest of four children. The aging Queen Victoria held him at his christening and he wriggled so much that he got her full square in the face with a fist and a foot, knocking off her spectacles. He always told me that at only a few weeks old, he couldn&#x2019;t possibly have known he was to be &#x201c;seen and not heard&#x201d; while in the queen&#x2019;s arms.<br> <br>My father was blessed with enlightened parents. His mother in particular thought that children should not only be seen and very much heard but that they should also be exposed to new ideas and the classics. She kept meticulous records of the books she read and was always keen to try new experiences. Passionate about cartography, she worked for many years on a detailed geological map of Malta, participated in archaeological digs, and rather daringly, scooping up my father to provide the required extra weight, flew in a zeppelin airship and a very early model of a biplane, even though, as she said, &#x201c;it was not made to carry passengers and we perched securely on a little stool holding on to the flier&#x2019;s back.&#x201d; Coming from a line of progressive thinkers, she taught my father herself until he was ten years old, gifting him an education that was thorough and polymathic. She taught him to be open-minded, methodical, and thorough, and above all encouraged him to enjoy learning, to inquire. Later, when I got to know my grandmother, I could see how entirely free of prejudice she was, how interested she was in all that was around her, and just how much of an influence she had had on my father&#x2019;s refreshing way of viewing the world. She was to be an inspiring force in my life.<br> <br>A month before his tenth birthday my father was sent to Lockers Park prep school in Hertfordshire, and two years later he entered the Royal Naval College at Osborne. As war became inevitable, at the beginning of 1914, his German-born father was forced to retire from the Admiralty as first sea lord because of the anti-German hysteria at large in the country, scurrilous newspaper headlines whipping people up into a frenzy of hatred. My grandfather resigned, even though the navy was solidly behind him, and this episode had a profound effect on my father, who vowed to succeed to the position of his wronged father. Then, during the war, when King George V decreed that the royal family should anglicize their name, choosing Windsor, my grandfather changed his from Battenberg to Mountbatten. The king created him the Marquess of Milford Haven, having offered him the title of duke, but, practical to the last and looking around him at the grandeur of the English nobility, he calculated that as his savings had been decimated in the German economic downturn, he simply didn&#x2019;t have the wealth that would be expected of him with that rank: an English duke had to maintain a grand style of life. My father also ceased to be the younger Prince Louis of Battenberg and received the courtesy title of Lord Louis Mountbatten.<br> <br>During the First World War, my father joined Lord Beatty&#x2019;s flagship HMS Lion as a midshipman, and later he was appointed first lieutenant of a small ship, HMS P31, and for a time, aged only eighteen, he found himself in command of a crew of sixty. Through Princess Mary my father contrived that King George V should come on board during the Peace Pageant on the Thames. He saluted smartly as the monarch came aboard. &#x201c;Hello, Dickie,&#x201d; said the king jovially, &#x201c;how&#x2019;s Chicken Bella?&#x201d; The fact that his sovereign remembered the stupid doll he had had as a two-year-old mortified the nineteen-year-old second in command and exposed him to remorseless teasing.<br> <br>The Admiralty now sent the &#x201c;war babies&#x201d; who had been unable to complete their education to Cambridge University, and my father went with both Prince Albert and Prince Henry. They all led a wildly social life, falling in and out of love between studying. Tall, with the good looks of a Hollywood film star, my father was very much in demand. He was also in demand from the royal household, accompanying the Prince of Wales&#x2014;the future King Edward VIII&#x2014;as his personal aide-de-camp, on tours including Australia and, later, India and Japan.<br> <br>Grace Kelly once confided that she had always kept a photograph of my father before she met Prince Rainier. Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, a fiercely rich American society hostess, nicknamed &#x201c;the Kingfisher&#x201d; for her relentless cultivation of European royalty, singled my father out as the perfect suitor for her only daughter. When she invited him to a tea party on her yacht off Cowes, my father was immediately smitten, falling helplessly in love at first sight. Only it wasn&#x2019;t quite as Mrs. Vanderbilt had intended, for on board that afternoon was a gathering of young ladies, including Edwina Ashley, an effortlessly glamorous heiress, who had recently learned to stand with her hips pushed slightly forward, the very image of beau monde chic. With one hand on her slender hip, the charms of her gold bracelet glinting off the other in the sun, my father was at once dazzled and delighted. Although they had met a couple of times previously, they began to court in earnest, and when my father went to India with the prince, Edwina followed him, staying at the Viceregal Lodge. It became obvious to all that they were very much in love, so much so that the Prince of Wales lent them his sitting room so that my father could propose.<br> <br>On 18 July 1922, they were married in St. Margaret&#x2019;s, Westminster, tucked in the shadow of Westminster Abbey on Parliament Square. It was the most talked-about society wedding of the year, and when my mother walked out on the arm of her dashing husband, beneath a naval arch of swords, they were congratulated by a host of royals, including King George V, Queen Mary, and the Queen Mother, Alexandra. At the sumptuous reception, the Prince of Wales gave the best man&#x2019;s speech, following which my parents enjoyed a rather protracted honeymoon, traveling to France, Spain, Germany, and the States, where they stayed with Hollywood&#x2019;s royalty, the king and queen of silent movies, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. They even made a short silent home movie with Charlie Chaplin entitled Nice and Easy, in which Charlie played a rogue trying to steal the pearls of the heroine (my mother), who is rescued by her lover (my father). My mother&#x2019;s performance showed suitable girlish alarm, my father&#x2019;s acting was dreadful, and of course Charlie stole the show. Happily exhausted, they returned to Manhattan for the last days of their adventure, where they stayed as guests of the very game Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, who bore no grudges.<br> <br>Marriage, my father&#x2019;s love, and a sense of her own destiny&#x2014;this is just what my mother needed. Since her &#x201c;coming out&#x201d; she had been living with her grandfather, Sir Ernest Cassell, in his London home, Brook House, stoically hosting his large parties of elderly grandees and financiers, but his death in the year before her marriage had left my mother feeling empty, memories of her lonely childhood flooding back to her. Raised by a series of nannies and housekeepers in Broadlands, a large Palladian mansion near Romsey in Hampshire, Edwina and her younger sister, Mary, were mostly kept apart from their parents. Her mother, Maudie, suffered from consumption and, as her condition deteriorated, she spent more and more time away, particularly in Egypt. Their father, Wilfred, a Conservative MP, was rarely at home either, busy attending to his political duties. My mother&#x2019;s early letters show how anxious she was to see her &#x201c;darling mother&#x201d; again. Having been misled by a well-intentioned suggestion from their governess, my mother believed that the reason for their separation was that she was going to be a sister again, and she wrote to her mother at least twice expressing her and Mary&#x2019;s desire to have a little brother. After a while the penny dropped and she tried to keep the desperation out of her letters, going out of her way to keep her tone upbeat. When Maudie finally returned to Broadlands, it was thought too upsetting for the children to witness their mother&#x2019;s failing health, so they were sent away to a cousin. And even though my mother wrote several times with growing urgency and despair, pleading to see her mother again, she was never allowed to, and Maudie died in February 1911. My mother and Mary did not attend the funeral.<br> <br>My mother was brave, hiding her emotions well, containing her sister, who became very difficult, throwing tantrums and creating scenes. It seemed that she was the only one who could calm Mary down, and forever after, she felt responsible for her younger sister&#x2019;s safety and well-being. A subdued period of existence followed, during which time the girls learned to pour their bruised feelings into caring for a menagerie of domestic pets&#x2014;puppies, ponies, rabbits, kittens, and a goat. For a brief while, their lives were cheered and enriched by the arrival of Laura Deveira, a loving young governess to whom the sisters became deeply attached, but just as they began to settle down and come out of their protective shells, their father presented them with a new stepmother and the world came crashing down again.<br> <br>Molly Forbes-Sempill replaced their beloved Miss Deveira with a governess of her choice and sent the girls to bed every evening by half past six so they were &#x201c;out of the way,&#x201d; a phrase that deeply upset my mother. My mother and aunt were forbidden to pick a single flower from the garden from the moment she moved in, and Broadlands became a sterile and difficult place in which to live. Eventually my mother went to school near Eastbourne&#x2014;another lonely place for her&#x2014;where the pupils took it in turns &#x201c;hooking up Miss Potts,&#x201d; a humiliating task involving wrestling with endless hooks and buttons in order to help the headmistress secure her dress each morning. Things improved little more when, aged eighteen, my mother was sent to a domestic science training college. It was while here that she vowed never to go back and live at Broadlands while her stepmother was alive. On leaving she went to live in London with her grandfather, Sir Ernest.<br> <br>Life changed for the better when she met my father. They had both been recently touched by death&#x2014;my father distraught at the loss of his father, my mother by the unexpected death of her grandfather&#x2014;and initially they sought solace in each other. As time passed, however, and finally freed from her past, rich from her inheritance (which included Brook House), and happily in love, my mother found life opening up for her. This was the beginning of the &#x201c;roaring twenties,&#x201d; a time of exuberance and great optimism: jazz, dance, and liberating new styles. My mother was fashionably slender&#x2014;she referred to herself as a &#x201c;straight actress&#x201d; with vital statistics of twenty-six all the way down&#x2014;and she took full advantage of the freedom afforded to women now that bustles and corsets were obstructions of the past. She soon cut her hair short � la mode and kept it immaculately coiffed. As hemlines rose and shoes became more prominent, my mother had hers handmade in Paris, a pair in every color. This was the extravagant time in my parents&#x2019; lives&#x2014;they had a cinema screen installed in Brook House and hosted regular parties at which princes, even kings and queens, could rub shoulders with the likes of No�l Coward, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. By playing it at her parties, my mother made &#x201c;The Man I Love&#x201d; an overnight hit in England after Gershwin told her how upset he was that it had flopped in the United States. She danced the Charleston with Fred Astaire, and the rumors that Queen Mary didn&#x2019;t approve of this kind of behavior made the dancing all the more delicious.<br> <br>If they weren&#x2019;t entertaining at home, my parents went out to clubs, and it was only when they arrived that the party really got started. Once they had danced into the early hours, they would return to Brook House, music ringing in their ears, and collapse into bed. As was the fashion in those days, they kept separate bedrooms&#x2014;my father&#x2019;s decorated to look like a ship&#x2019;s cabin, a porthole in the wall with an ingenious &#x201c;view&#x201d; of Malta built behind. He had designed the light switch himself so that when turned down it emitted a low hum, like that of a ship&#x2019;s engine, and this helped him get to sleep. The walls were pale green and the carpet black, the bed was covered in a thick orange cotton quilt handwoven in Malta&#x2014;this much I know because it would be the same wherever we lived thereafter. My mother slept next door between pink satin sheets with a swan&#x2019;s-down quilt covered in pink ostrich feathers so that it appeared to float.<br> <br>During the first mo...</p><h2>Alanna: The First Adventure (The Song of the Lioness Book One)</h2><p>Eleven-year-old Alanna, who aspires to be a knight even though she is a girl, disguises herself as a boy to become a royal page, a learning many hard lessons along her path to high adventure.</p><p>Call it fate, call it intuition, or just call it common sense, but somehow young Alanna knows she isn't meant to become some proper lady cloistered in a convent.

One asserts that homosexual acts are legitimate, the other that they are not, Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic presents a psychoanalytic interpretation that shifts the focus of the debate from the legitimacy of sexual expression to the underlying needs. This new and controversial argument is contained in this much needed reassessment and restatement of the traditional Christian distinction between the homosexual condition and its expression in homosexual activity.</p><p>Moberly is known as the originator of gender-affirmative therapy for homosexuals.</p><h2>A Temple of Texts</h2><p>From one of the most admired essayists and novelists at work today: a new collection of essays&#x2014;his first since <i>Tests of Time</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism. <br><br>These twenty-five essays speak to the nature and value of writing and to the books that result from a deep commitment to the word. Here is Gass on Rilke and Gertrude Stein; on friends such as Stanley Elkin, Robert Coover, and William Gaddis; and on a company of &#x201c;healthy dissidents,&#x201d; among them Rabelais, Elias Canetti, John Hawkes, and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. <br><br>In the title essay, Gass offers an annotated list of the fifty books that have most influenced his thinking and his work and writes about his first reaction to reading each. Among the books: Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x2019;s <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> (&#x201c;A lightning bolt,&#x201d; Gass writes. &#x201c;Philosophy was not dead after all. Philosophical ambitions were not extinguished. Philosophical beauty had not fled prose.&#x201d;) . . . Ben Jonson&#x2019;s <i>The Alchemist</i> (&#x201c;A man after my own heart. He is capable of the simplest lyrical stroke, as bold and direct as a line by Matisse, but he can be complex in a manner that could cast Nabokov in the shade . . . Shakespeare may have been smarter, but he did not know as much.&#x201d;) . . . Gustave Flaubert&#x2019;s letters (&#x201c;Here I learned&#x2014;and learned&#x2014;and learned.&#x201d;) And after reading Malory&#x2019;s <i>Le Morte d&#x2019;Arthur</i>, Gass writes &#x201c;I began to eat books like an alien worm.&#x201d;<br><br>In the concluding essay, &#x201c;Evil,&#x201d; Gass enlarges upon the themes of artistic quality and cultural values that are central to the books he has considered, many of which seek to reveal the worst in people while admiring what they do best.<br>As Gass writes, &#x201c;The true alchemists do not change lead into gold, they change the world into words.&#x201d;<br><br><i>A Temple of Texts</i> is Gass at his most alchemical.</p><p>William H. Gass&#x2014;essayist, novelist, literary critic&#x2014;was born in Fargo, North Dakota. He has been the recipient of the first PEN/Nabokov Award, the PEN/Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award for the Art of the Essay, three National Book Critics Circle Awards for Criticism, a Lannan Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, the Award for Fiction and the Medal of Merit for Fiction from the Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and fellowships from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim Foundations.

You have been doing this at a time when not only are the classics regarded by many as one cause of our wretched world&#x2019;s unjust condition but at a time when the very word classic has become suspect, and is used most neutrally now to qualify old cars in good condition or to single out products stuck in an agreeable rut while the world furiously alters around them, such as Classic Saran Wrap or Classic Coke, although original is more frequently preferred, along with old-fashioned, to describe the Colonel&#x2019;s original recipe, or dad&#x2019;s best girl before she became his ball and chain.<br><br> When coined in the reign of Servius Tullius during the sixth century b.c., it meant the group, among citizens, to be called upon first; that is, during a time of war, the strongest, boldest, bravest, most fit to fight; while, when the state faced choices of difficulty and moment, the wisest, most temperate, and fair; so that then, when it was used of writers, it referred to those of the first rank, and also, by an obvious step, to their works. Therefore it should now designate, with regard to the education of a citizenry still concerned with their community, the books that have most completely represented and embodied its culture, as well as those that will best instruct, enlarge, and ennoble the mind, discipline the passions, and encourage a useful and respectful approach to experience.<br><br> A classic in its field is a work with which one should begin if one expects to master its subject; something that is therefore seminal, not only begetting more books that take it as their topic but also one that contains the discipline&#x2019;s founding principles, or serves as the starting point for its exploration, as Jefferson City, Missouri, once did for wagons entering our uncharted West. Even if you are in determined opposition to some traditional position, it is with the classic text you must begin the fight, though if the fight is to be fair, you must accept the risk, implicit in the inequality of the contest, of defeat, and of a turn to your heart, and of a change to your mind.<br><br> Literary classics break new ground, instigate change, or establish fresh standards of value, enlarging the scope of the canon, discovering new qualities of excellence, and confirming the importance of range, depth, mastery, and perfection in any artistic activity. It is instructive to observe that those who have carefully cultivated such a field of endeavor are not after yield per acre, but excellence per inch.<br><br> Oddly enough, people have always distrusted the classics, but it is now publicly acceptable to take pride in such distrust. We all dislike intimidation, so we worry about being overwhelmed by these tomes above which halos hover as over the graves of the recently sainted, because we wrongly believe they are fields full of esoteric knowledge worse than nettles, of specialized jargon, seductive rhetoric, and swarms of stinging data, and that the purpose of all this unpleasantness is to show us up, put us in our place, make fun of our lack of understanding; but the good books are notable for their paucity of information&#x2014;a classic is as careful about what it picks up as about what it puts down; it introduces new concepts because fresh ideas are needed; and only if the most ordinary things are exotic is it guilty of a preoccupation with the out-of-the-way, since the ordinary, the everyday, is their most concentrated concern: What could be more familiar than a child rolling for fun down a grassy slope&#x2014;that is, when seen by Galileo, a body descending an inclined plane? What could be more commonplace than Bertrand Russell&#x2019;s penny, lying naked on an examining table, awaiting the epistemologist&#x2019;s report on the problems of its perception? What could be less distinguished a subject for Maynard Keynes&#x2019;s ruminations on the source of its value than such a modest coin? Why should the question&#x2014;What good is that?&#x2014;alarm us, or why, in an age when most of the world worships money but calls its chosen God Father instead of Chairman, Lord instead of Coach, Most High instead of Star, should we shy from the same questions Plato asked, and not ask them about our business, about our love affairs, about our lip-served gods, about democracy?<br><br> Classics are by popular accord quite old and therefore out of date; while by the resentful they are representative only of the errors of their age, their lines sewn always on the bias, their authors willing tools of power and unjust privilege. Odd, then, that the good books were usually poisons in their time, when those biased pages were burned, those compliant authors jailed, and their ideas deemed diseases of the worst kind&#x2014;corruptions of the spirit&#x2014;to be fought with propaganda first, followed by prison, fire and firing squad, the gallows and the stake, all at the behest of the powers in place&#x2014;majesties, Popes, czars, sultans, CEOs, and CIAs&#x2014;the writers&#x2019; names made to stand for Machiavellian casts of character, Marxian acts of mischief, Humean disbelief, and not for the clear-eyed hard-boiled arguments, exposures, revelations, condemnations, and realities their works contained.<br><br> The good books are the fruit of the tree of knowledge all right, and the devil is always offering us another fellow&#x2019;s damned opinion, which, were we to sample it, might cause the scales to fall from our eyes, so to see suddenly that king and queen, God and all the angels, are naked, shivering, and in sore need of shoes. That is why just one good book, however greatly good, when used to bludgeon every other, turns evil; why we should be omnivorous: try kale, try squid, try rodent on a spit, try water even though there&#x2019;s wine, try fasting even, try&#x2014;good heavens!&#x2014;rice with beans. The good books are cookbooks and good readers read them, try them, stain their pages, adjust ingredients, pencil in evaluations, warn and recommend their recipes to friends.<br><br> I think it is usually wise to approach a contemporary work with skepticism; it is the new work&#x2019;s task to establish its authority, to persuade you to believe in its essential worth whatever strange or commonplace thing it may say or do. With a classic, the situation is otherwise. Arnold Bennett once wrote a little book he called Literary Taste, a work of such immense good sense, it surprised me, for I did not expect it from a devoted follower of Zola&#x2019;s naturalism, an Edwardian down to his steam yacht. It is a book of admirably blunt assurance. He informs his readers, and there were many, that &#x201c;your taste has to pass before the bar of the classics. That is the point. If you differ with a classic, it is you who are wrong, and not the book.&#x201d; Bennett is talking about taste&#x2014;the perception of excellence&#x2014;not about truth. Regarding the truth, you are earnestly entreated to differ. Appreciation is Bennett&#x2019;s subject and reading&#x2019;s desired result. If you do not admire the writings of Thomas Hobbes, it is not Hobbes whose ghost now has to feel uneasy. Of course, adjustments must always be made. It may be that in a state of nature, since it is a state of war, the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, but in our present state of mediocrity, it is cowardly, shallow, tedious, banal, and uselessly drawn out.<br><br> The good books provide us with the most varied of intellectual diets, and not liking broccoli or squid or beets or brains or kidneys or kohlrabi is not permitted the cultivated palate, nor is a disdain for Pascal, which I confess I have, nor a dislike for Saint Paul, despite his disagreeable ideas, nor a failure to appreciate the sublime vision of Plotinus and to shiver at his ecstatic yet melancholy summation of the highest spiritual life of man&#x2014;with its unbearable lightness of being&#x2014;as &#x201c;detachment from all things here below, scorn of all earthly pleasures, and flight of the alone to the alone.&#x201d; The healthy mind goes everywhere, one day visiting Saint Francis, another accepting tea from C�line&#x2019;s bitter pot&#x2014;ask for two sugars, please&#x2014;and hiking many a hard mile through Immanuel Kant or the poetry of Paul Celan&#x2014;a pair who will provide a better workout than the local gym&#x2014;before taking a hard-earned vacation in the warm and luscious fictions of Colette. You will live longer and better by consuming deliciously chewy fats and reading Proust than by treadmilling to a Walkman tune and claiming to be educated because you peruse the Wall Street Journal and have recently skimmed something by Tom Wolfe.<br><br> Nothing too much but everything a little bit&#x2014;this describes the classic diet. One needs a bit of Wittgenstein to balance all that Hegel, a dash of Chekhov to counter Dostoyevsky, and some Sterne to maintain one&#x2019;s sanity after a series of unscheduled encounters with Sir Walter Scott. It is a blessed variety, like that of a blooming garden: so many ways to grow, to be fruitful, to captivate, to soothe, and to be beautiful.<br><br> Emerson understood well the importance of keeping company with greatness, for you cannot improve your chess game by playing against those whom you can speedily put to rout; only when you take on opponents who can give you a sound thrashing will you learn how to win with grace. Yet, what is the goodness that makes the good books good? That confers this greatness on the great ones? Whence comes the character of &#x201c;the classic&#x201d; that gives it that cachet?<br><br> They glow because their authors are such fine, upsta...</p><h2>It is Halloween!

After the tragedy, she was &#x201c;The Taconic Mom,&#x201d; whose unimaginable loss embodied every parent&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Suddenly, her life-long Catholic faith no longer explained the world. Her marriage to her husband, Warren, was ravaged by wrenching grief and recrimination. And her mind, unable to cope with the unfathomable, reinvented reality each night, so she awoke each morning having forgotten the heartbreaking facts: that Emma, age 8; Alyson, age 7; and Katie, age 5, were gone forever. They were killed in a minivan driven by their aunt, Jackie&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Diane Schuler, while returning from a camping weekend on a sunny July morning.<br> <br> <i>I&#x2019;ll See You Again</i> chronicles the day Jackie received the traumatizing phone call that defied all understanding, and the numbed and torturous events that followed&#x2014;including the devastating medical findings that shattered Jackie to the core and shocked America. But this profoundly honest account is also the story of how a tight-knit community rallied around the Hances, providing the courage and strength for them to move forward. It&#x2019;s a story of forgiveness, hope, and rebirth, as Jackie and Warren struggle to rediscover the possibility of joy by welcoming their fourth daughter, Kasey Rose Hance.<br> <br> The story that Jackie Hance shares for the first time will touch your heart and warm you to the power of love and hope.</p><p>Jackie Hance lives with her family in New York.

The book is composed of two main sections: Section one describes the complete grooming cycle; from start to finish, section two has the complete instructions for grooming each 193 recognized AKC breeds. Section one dedicates time to ear care, eye care, the face, nails, pads, caring for the coat bathing process, finish the dog and more. It goes over common mistakes groomers make that put our health in jeopardy. You will find exercises and warm ups to start the day and there is a lot of emphasis on safety. Chapter two is dedicated to handling and control, in my opinion, one of the most important steps of the grooming process. I have been in situations with dogs that other salons hate and banned and because of my handling process, they are angels in my table. Do you know how to choose your table, equipment and tools available these days? I can go over every chapter in this book and how these pages are full of fantastic advice for new or seasoned groomers. One of my favorites parts on the book is the amount of photos in it when he is talking about a specific tool or technique there is a photo next to it to help you visualize it. The language is very easy to read and understand and all the instructions are easy to follow. You know how a conditioner freak I am well, they have a chart with the recommended conditioner based on the type of coat, I look at this book every night and every night I find something new or a better way to do it compared of how I am doing it now. When Mrs. Kohl emailed me and let me know she sent me the book, she asked me a question how many new things I learned from the book they did not teach me at school? I lost the count already. No matter what school you went, you would find new or different techniques for basic grooming. The attention to detail on this guide is amazing. I love doing the schnauzer, no matter how many I have done the eyebrows are never the same, I always go back again to even them over and over. On this guide I learn how to use the curve shear and to point it to a specific area of the nose to make them long or short and I only do one cut now, I just love the way my schnauzer brows look all the time now. Do you use one of those magnetic strips to hold your blades? You will find out why you need to stop doing that. Proper body positioning for scissoring or styling, there is a little guide to clip the nail and it tells you when to stop before the quick. I mean the list goes on and on. It is fantastic. Now the second part is the best. First it start with canine anatomy, a seasoned groomer may know all this but some times I was reading instructions for a specific groom and they where mentioning the stifle, the tuck-up, point of rump, point of shoulder and I have no idea what they where talking about. There is a complete chart in the book. All the breeds are on alphabetical order by the name. In my old book I had to know the breed group to find them, on this one I just need to know the name. I will tell you all the equipment you will need or is recommended for each breed. Then you will have step-by-step instructions with a small chart with numbers corresponding to the instructions....

Fifty-six dog teams will race through 1,151 miles of rugged Alaskan terrain from Anchorage to Nome. Akiak knows these miles well. As lead dog, she has raced the incredible trail before, but never won. She is ten years old: if she is going to win, it must be now.<br><br>When snow hurts her paw on the fourth day out, Mick, her musher, must leave her behind and continue the race without her. The rules say once a dog is dropped from the race, it may not rejoin the team. But Akiak doesn't know about rules. She is a lead dog, and her place is with the team. Nothing, not blizzards, not breaking ice, not the people out to catch her, will stop Akiak from catching up to her team. The question is, can the team still win?<br><br>Robert J. Blake's majestic snowscapes will lead you through this unforgettable tale of a dog with a hero's heart, a dog who will not give up. Akiak will leave you cheering.</p><p>Robert J. Blake was born and raised in New Jersey. As a boy he made "tons of drawings" and used up thousands of crayons. He says, "I even did a huge crayon mural on our hallway that was not artistically appreciated by my parents."<p> Sharing one large room with two older brothers was "total chaos," he recalls. "We had lots of animals - dogs, ducks, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, lizards, turtles, snakes, birds, fish, and even two flying squirrels. And, oh yes, a tarantula. I think my parents were afraid to come up to our room."</p><p> Mr. Blake now resides in New Jersey with his wife and son. He works in his studio, a renovated barn on his property. Mr. Blake says, "I would like to paint in every state in the United States and in every country in the world."</p><p> "I hope my books lend the reader a feeling, and emotion, a new point of view, a new way to look at something that they might not have experienced otherwise."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>From Jack London's Call of the Wild to Gary Paulsen's many tales, the relationship between humans and dogs as they face the harsh northern climes has captivated readers. Recapitulating that theme is Blake's story of the 1,151-mile Iditarod from Anchorage to Nome; Mick's lead dog is Akiak, who pounds through wind and across snow, never getting lost. Then, on Day Four, ice jams up one of Akiak's pawpads and she is taken out of the race and almost flown home. She twists free of her handler before the plane takes off, pushes through blizzards and past checkpoints, sticking to the trail and eventually meeting up with Mick; according to the rules, Akiak cannot be harnessed up again but she does prevent her mistress from taking the wrong trail before climbing aboard the sled for the ride to a first-place finish. Blake's naturalistic icy blue paintings chronicle Akiak's independent race across lone landscapes, burrowing in snowdrifts for shelter and escaping well-meaning trail volunteers. The rugged style translates well from the ocean setting of Spray (1996) to the untamed Alaskan terrain; the textured slathers of oil paint in repeated cold tones are perfect for icy plains, tracks in the snow, and rooftop icicles. Akiak's efforts may not constitute life-and-death drama, but young readers will cheer the heroic dog on in this satisfying outdoor adventure.

Although by appearances glamorous and truly thrilling, growing up as the daughter of Judy Garland was anything but a journey over the rainbow.<p>With unsparing candor, Lorna Luft offers the first-ever insider portrait of one of Hollywood's most celebrated families: a rare story of a little girl, her half-sister Liza, and her baby brother trying desperately to hang on to the mother whose life seemed destined to burn brightly but briefly. Lorna makes an extraordinary journey back into the spiral of love, addiction, pain, and loss that lurked behind a charmed facade.</p><p>Filled with behind-the-scenes dramas, hilarious untold stories, and little-known details of Garland family life, ME AND MY SHADOWS is a tribute to Lorna's victory over her own past, a story of hope, of love and its limitations, and a deeply moving testament to the healing powers of embracing one's past and charting a course of self-love of discovery.</p>Lorna Luft made her television debut singing "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" on her mother's 1963 Christmas special. She has appeared on and off Broadway in <i>Lolita, Promises, Promises,</i> and <i>Snoopy;</i> in national tours of <i>Grease, They're Playing Our Song,</i> and <i>Guys and Dolls;</i> at the Rainbow Room, the Hollywood Bowl, and the White House; in the television series <i>Trapper John, M.D.,</i> and <i>Caroline in the City;</i> and as Paulette in the movie <i>Grease 2.</i> She lives in Los Angeles with her husband, son, and daughter.</p><h2>Beautiful Shadow: A Life of Patricia Highsmith</h2><p><p>The life of Patricia Highsmith was as secretive and unusual as that of many of the best-known characters who people her "peerlessly disturbing" thrillers and short stories. Yet even as her work has found new popularity in the last few years, the life of this famously elusive writer has remained a mystery. </p><p>For <i>Beautiful Shadow</i>, the first biography of Highsmith, British journalist Andrew Wilson mined the vast archive of diaries, notebooks, and letters she left behind, astonishing in their candor and detail. He interviewed her closest friends and colleagues as well as some of her many lovers. But Wilson also traces Highsmith's literary roots in the work of Poe, noir, and existentialism, locating the influences that helped distinguish Highsmith's writing so startlingly from more ordinary thrillers. The result is both a serious critical biography and one that reveals much about a brilliant and contradictory woman, one who despite her acclaim and affairs always maintained her solitude.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrew Wilson</b> has written for most of Britain's national newspapers, including the <i>Daily Telegraph, </i>the <i>Guardian, </i>the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>. This is his first book.</p>While British journalist Wilson's portrait of Highsmith (1921-1995) is neither graceful nor fluid, it is as haunting and as chilling as the stories and novels Highsmith crafted over more than 50 productive years. The author of Strangers on a Train and five novels featuring the amoral and murderous Tom Ripley, Highsmith achieved considerable critical acclaim in her native United States, but never sold well here. She was better received in Europe and that was where she made her home. The biographer's exhaustive attention to detail coupled with his access to Highsmith's journals (or "cahiers," as she called them) and letters, and extensive interviews with her friends, lovers and associates, allow him to reveal in excruciating detail this very private person. Highsmith emerges as a woman of great intelligence, candor and curiosity, but also as a racially prejudiced, anti-Semitic and insensitive boor. She was an acute observer capable of seizing a single incident and transforming it into a complex story. But she was unable to transform her own unhappy life. Instead she transmuted her troubles, her experiences, her observations into her work. One of her lovers observed, "If she hadn't had her work, she would have been sent to an insane asylum or an alcoholics' home.... She was her writing." Highsmith's work has had an important impact on both crime fiction and gay and lesbian fiction, and Wilson has impressively documented that as well as the tremendous cost Highsmith paid for her achievements. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shout!

The first group included the Five Hymns to Sri Arunachala, of which the first poem, The Marital Garland of Letters, &#34;is among the most profound and moving poems in any language&#34; and expressses the attitude of the soul aspiring for union with God.

Like medicine, philosophy to them was a rigorous science aimed both at understanding and at producing the flourishing of human life. In this engaging book, Martha Nussbaum examines texts of philosophers committed to a therapeutic paradigm--including Epicurus, Lucretius, Sextus Empiricus, Chrysippus, and Seneca--and recovers a valuable source for our moral and political thought of today.</p></p><p>"Filled with many beautifully written and powerful passages, this book will provoke lively discussion among specialists and show nonspecialists how much there is to be gained from a serious study of this period."--Brad Inwood, University of Toronto|<p>"Filled with many beautifully written and powerful passages, this book will provoke lively discussion among specialists and show nonspecialists how much there is to be gained from a serious study of this period."<b>--Brad Inwood, University of Toronto</b></p><p>"Filled with many beautifully written and powerful passages, this book will provoke lively discussion among specialists and show nonspecialists how much there is to be gained from a serious study of this period."--<b>Brad Inwood, University of Toronto</b></p></p><h2>The Foothills Cuisine of Blackberry Farm: Recipes and Wisdom from Our Artisans, Chefs, and Smoky Mountain Ancestors : A Cookbook</h2><p>Step into the world of top luxury resort Blackberry Farm, where lovers of farm-to-table cuisine and the lost arts of Southern cooking will find bliss in the gorgeous photographs, enticing recipes, and artisanal food-making tutorials of this transporting book.<br><br> Blackberry Farm has long been lauded as one of the country's most excellent resorts and sought out for its perfect mix of rusticity and refinement. <i>The Blackberry Farm Cookbook</i> was a love letter to the experience and cuisine of Blackberry Farm.

Every day, Blackberry Farm's chefs, gardeners, cheese-makers, and preservationists use wisdom passed down through generations of mountain residents. Following the natural rhythms of eight seasons or "times" allows cooks to coax the most heady dishes out of what's fresh and best, such as Lay by Time's menu of Mountain Multigrain Bread, Fried Catfish and Cucumber Slaw, Green Tomato Pie, and Banana Peanut Butter Pudding.

When hot from the oven, southern corn bread is as moist as it'll be, and full of corn flavor with nary a touch of sweet beyond what the corn gives.</p> <p>Fresh corn bread was served as an accompaniment to a meal such as beans and greens, contributing both flavor and function, as it could be used to soak up every last lick of pot likker. Cold leftover corn bread might be served for dessert or, even better, breakfast the next day, perhaps as "bread and milk," crumbled right into a tall glass of buttermilk and seasoned to taste with a few grinds of black pepper or a spoonful of sorghum. Or the bread can be split, fried cut-side-down on the griddle, and then drizzled with sorghum and buttermilk. This is one of my favorite breakfasts!</p> <p><em>Serves 6</em></p> <p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>3 tablespoons bacon fat, or 1-1/2 tablespoons each unsalted butter and vegetable oil </li> <li>2 cups (11 ounces) stone-ground yellow cornmeal</li> <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li> <li>1 large egg</li> <li>1-1/2 cups well-shaken buttermilk</li> </ul> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 450�F. If using bacon fat, place it in a well-seasoned 9-inch cast-iron skillet and place the skillet in the oven as it preheats. If using butter and oil, wait until step 3 to heat the skillet.</p> <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk.</p> <p>If using butter and oil, heat them in the skillet over high heat until the oil is shimmering.</p> <p>Pour the egg mixture into the cornmeal mixture and stir just until blended and smooth. Be prepared to immediately transfer the batter into a hot skillet.</p> <p>Remove the hot skillet from the oven or from the stovetop. Carefully scrape the batter into the skillet. The batter should sizzle vigorously around the edges.</p> <p>Place the skillet in the oven and bake until the corn bread is firm and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes.

It covers the basic mathematics of real estate finance and investments, while stressing the ambiguity of decision making. It is an exploration of the key concepts of real estate finance and investment strategy. It is not a mere formulaic analysis of numbers designed to give you "the answer" to any and all real estate investment decisions. <br> <br> Instead, the book is designed to help you understand that there is no singular or simplistic answer to any real estate finance problem. Rather, real estate finance is fundamentally driven by judgment and experience, with an eye to the numbers. <br> <br> The goal is to help you evaluate the risks and opportunities of real estate assets and investments, and will hopefully help you embark upon the long and unending road of strengthening your judgment.</p><p></p><h2>The Bat (Harry Hole Series)</h2><p><p>The electrifying first appearance of Jo Nesbo&#x2019;s detective, Harry Hole.<br><br>Inspector Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad is dispatched to Sydney to observe a murder case.

It didn&#x2019;t �really matter; Harry wasn&#x2019;t particularly accustomed to foreign travel or snobbish&#x2014;all he wanted was a hotel room and a bed as quickly as possible.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he had replied, drumming his fingers on the counter.<br><br>And that was when her lips had pursed, turned ugly and articulated, with a pointed tone: &#x201c;Why isn&#x2019;t there a visa in your passport, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>His heart sank, as it invariably did when there was a hint of a catastrophe in the offing. Perhaps &#x201c;sir&#x201d; was used only when situ�ations became critical?<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, I forgot,&#x201d; Harry mumbled, searching feverishly through his inside pockets. Why had they not been able to pin a special visa in his passport as they do with standard visas? Behind him in the queue he heard the faint drone of a Walkman and realized it was his traveling companion from the plane. He had been playing the same cassette the whole flight. Why the hell could he never remember which pocket he put things in? It was hot as well, even though it was getting on for ten o&#x2019;clock at night. Harry could feel his scalp beginning to itch.<br><br>At last he found the document and placed it on the count�er, to his great relief.<br><br>&#x201c;Police officer, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The passport official looked up from the special visa and studied him, but the pursed mouth was gone.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope no Norwegian blondes have been murdered?&#x201d;<br><br>She chuckled and smacked the stamp down hard on the special visa.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, just the one,&#x201d; Harry Hole answered.<br><br>The arrivals hall was crowded with travel reps and limousine drivers, holding up signs with names on, but not a Hole in sight. He was on the point of grabbing a taxi when a black man wearing light blue jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, and with an unusually broad nose and dark, curly hair plowed a furrow between the signs and came striding �toward him.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Holy, I presume!&#x201d; he declared triumphantly.<br><br>Harry Hole considered his options. He had decided to spend the first days in Australia correcting the pronunciation of his surname so that he wouldn&#x2019;t be confused with apertures or orifices. Mr. Holy however, was infinitely preferable.<br><br>&#x201c;Andrew Kensington. How are ya?&#x201d; the man grinned and stuck out an enormous fist.<br><br>It was nothing less than a juice extractor.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to Sydney. Hope you enjoyed the flight,&#x201d; the stranger said with evident sincerity, like an echo of the air hostess&#x2019;s announcement twenty minutes earlier. He took Harry&#x2019;s battered suitcase and began to walk �toward the exit without a backward glance. Harry kept close to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you work for Sydney police?&#x201d; he initiated.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure do, mate. Watch out!&#x201d;<br><br>The swing door hit Harry in the face, right on the hooter, and made his eyes water. A bad slapstick sketch could not have started worse. He rubbed his nose and swore in Norwegian. Kensington sent him a sympathetic look.<br><br>&#x201c;Bloody doors, eh?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Harry didn&#x2019;t answer. He didn&#x2019;t know how to answer that sort of comment down under.<br><br>In the car park Kensington unlocked the boot of a small, well-�used Toyota and shoved in the suitcase. &#x201c;Do you wanna drive, mate?&#x201d; he asked in surprise.<br><br>Harry realized he was sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat. Of course, they drove on the bloody left in Australia. However, the passenger seat was so full of papers, cassettes and general rubbish that Harry squeezed into the back.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be an Aboriginal,&#x201d; he said as they turned onto the motorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess there&#x2019;s no fooling you, Officer,&#x201d; Kensington answered, glancing in the mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;In Norway we call you Australian Negroes.&#x201d;<br><br>Kensington kept his eyes trained on the mirror. &#x201c;�Really?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry began to feel ill at ease. &#x201c;Er, by that I just mean that your forefathers obviously didn&#x2019;t belong to the convicts sent here from �En�gland two hundred years ago.&#x201d; He wanted to show he had at least a modicum of knowledge about the country&#x2019;s history.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Holy. My forefathers were here a bit before them. Forty thousand years, to be precise.&#x201d;<br><br>Kensington grinned into the mirror. Harry vowed to keep his mouth shut for a while.<br><br>&#x201c;I see. Call me Harry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK, Harry. I&#x2019;m Andrew.&#x201d;<br><br>Andrew ran the conversation for the rest of the ride. He drove Harry to King&#x2019;s Cross, holding forth the whole way: this area was Sydney&#x2019;s red-�light district and the center for the drugs trade and to a large extent all the other shady dealings in town. Every second scandal seemed to have a connection with some hotel or strip joint inside this square kilometer.<br><br>&#x201c;Here we are,&#x201d; Andrew said suddenly. He pulled in to the curb, jumped out and took Harry&#x2019;s suitcase from the boot.<br><br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Andrew said, and with that he and the car were gone. With a stiff back and jet lag beginning to announce its presence, Harry and his suitcase were now alone on a pavement in a town boasting a population roughly equivalent to the whole of Norway, outside the splendid Crescent Hotel. The name was printed on the door next to three stars. Oslo&#x2019;s Chief Constable was not known for largesse with regards to accommodation for her employees. But perhaps this one was not going to be too bad after all. There must have been a civil service discount and it was probably the hotel&#x2019;s smallest room, Harry reflected.<br><br>And it was.<br><br>2<br><br>Gap Park<br><br>Harry knocked warily on the door of the Head of Crime Squad for Surry Hills.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; boomed a voice from inside.<br><br>A tall, broad man with a stomach designed to impress was standing by the window, behind an oak desk. Beneath a thinning mane protruded gray bushy eyebrows, but the wrinkles around his eyes smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry Holy from Oslo, Norway, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take a pew, Holy. You look bloody fit for this time of the morning. I hope you haven&#x2019;t been to see any of the boys in Narc, have you?&#x201d; Neil McCormack let out a huge laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Jet lag. I&#x2019;ve been awake since four this morning, sir,&#x201d; Harry explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Just an in-�joke. We had a pretty high-�profile corruption case here a couple of years back, you see. Ten officers were convicted, among other things for selling drugs&#x2014;to one another. Suspicion was raised because a couple of them were so alert&#x2014;round the clock. No joke �really.&#x201d; He chuckled contentedly, put on his glasses and flicked through the papers in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve been sent here to assist us with our investigation into the murder of Inger Holter, a Norwegian citizen with a permit to work in Australia. Blonde, good-�looking girl, according to the photos. Twenty-�three years old, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry nodded. McCormack was serious now.<br><br>&#x201c;Found by fishermen on the ocean side of Watson&#x2019;s Bay&#x2014;to be more precise, Gap Park. Semi-�naked. Bruising suggested she had been raped first and then strangled, but no semen was found. Later transported at the dead of night to the park where the body was dumped off the cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled a face.<br><br>&#x201c;Had the weather been a little worse the waves would definitely have carried her out, but instead she lay among the rocks until she was found. As I said, there was no semen present, and the reason for that is that the vagina was sliced up like a filleted fish and the seawater did a thorough job of washing this girl clean. Therefore we have no fingerprints either, though we do have a rough estimate of time of death . . .&#x201d; McCormack removed his glasses and rubbed his face. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t have a murderer. And what the hell are you gonna do about that, Mr. Holy?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry was about to answer but was interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re gonna do is watch carefully while we haul the bastard in, tell the Norwegian press along the way what a wonderful job we&#x2019;re doing together&#x2014;making sure we don&#x2019;t offend anyone at the Norwegian Embassy, or relatives&#x2014;and otherwise enjoy a break and send a card or two to your dear Chief Constable. How is she by the way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, as far as I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great woman, she is. I s&#x2019;pose she explained to you what&#x2019;s expected of you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To some extent. I&#x2019;m taking part in an invest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. Forget all that. Here are the new rules. Number one: from now on you listen to me, me and me alone. Number two: you don&#x2019;t take part in anything you haven&#x2019;t been instructed to do by me. And number three: one toe out of line and you&#x2019;ll be on the first plane home.&#x201d;<br><br>This was delivered with a smile, but the message was clear: paws off, he was here as an observer. He might just as well have brought his swimming things and a camera along.<br><br>&#x201c;I gather that Inger Holter was some kind of TV celeb in Norway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A minor celeb, sir. She hosted a children&#x2019;s program broadcast a couple of years ago. I suppose before this happened she was on her way into oblivion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ve been told that your papers are making a big thing of this murder. Couple of them have sent people here already. We&#x2019;ve given &#x2019;em what we&#x2019;ve got, and that&#x2019;s not a great deal, so they&#x2019;ll soon be bored and bugger off home. They don&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re here. We&#x2019;ve got our own nannies, so you won&#x2019;t have to take care of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for that, sir,&#x201d; Harry said, and he meant it. The thought of panting Norwegian journalists looking over his shoulder was not a welcome one.<br><br>&#x201c;OK, Holy, I&#x2019;ll be honest with you and tell you how the land lies. I&#x2019;ve been told in no uncertain terms by my governor that councillors in Sydney would like to see this case cleared up as soon as possible. As usual, it&#x2019;s all about politics and dosh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dosh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we reckon unemployment in Sydney will rise to over ten percent this year, and the town needs every cent we can get from the tourists. We&#x2019;ve got the Olympic Games just round the corner, in 2000, and tourism from Scandinavia&#x2019;s on the up. Murder, especially one which hasn&#x2019;t been cleared up, isn&#x2019;t a good advert for the town, so we&#x2019;re doing what we can. We have a team of four detectives on the case plus high-�priority access to the force&#x2019;s resources&#x2014;all the computers, forensic staff, lab people. And so on.&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack pulled out a sheet of paper which he studied with a frown.<br><br>&#x201c;In fact, you should be working with Watkins, but since you specifically asked for Kensington, I see no reason to refuse your request.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, to my knowledge I haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kensington&#x2019;s a good man. There are not many Indigenous officers who have come up through the ranks like him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the way it is. Well, Holy, if there&#x2019;s anything else, you know where I hang out. Any questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er, just a formality, sir. I was wondering whether sir was the right mode of address to a superior officer in this country, or whether it was a little too . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Formal? Stiff? Yes, I guess it probably is. But I like it. It reminds me that I am in fact the boss of this outfit.&#x201d; McCormack burst out laughing and concluded the meeting with a bone-�crunching handshake.<br><br>&#x201c;January&#x2019;s the tourist season in Australia,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they lurched forward in the traffic around Circular Quay.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone comes to see the Sydney Opera House and go on boat trips round the harbor and admire the women on Bondi Beach. Shame you&#x2019;ve got to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry shook his head. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter. I break out in a cold sweat around tourist traps.&#x201d;<br><br>They emerged onto New South Head Road, where the Toyota sped eastward to Watson&#x2019;s Bay.<br><br>&#x201c;The East Side of Sydney&#x2019;s not exactly like the East End of London,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they passed one fashionable house after another. &#x201c;This district&#x2019;s called Double Bay. We call it Double Pay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did Inger Holter live?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She lived with her boyfriend in Newtown for a while before they split up and she moved to a little one-�room flat in Glebe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d;<br><br>Andrew shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Australian, a computer engineer and met her when she came here on holiday two years ago. He&#x2019;s got an alibi for the night of the murder and is not exactly the prototype of a murderer. But you never know, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>They parked below Gap Park, one of Sydney&#x2019;s many green lungs. Steep stone steps led up to the windblown park that lay high above Watson&#x2019;s Bay to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The heat hit them when they opened the car doors. Andrew put on a big pair of shades, which made Harry think of a laid-�back porn king. For some reason his Australian colleague was wearing a tight suit today, and Harry thought the broad-�shouldered black man looked a bit comical as he rolled and pitched up the path in front of him to the viewpoint.<br><br>Harry looked around. To the west he saw the city center with the Harbor Bridge, to the north the beach and yachts in Watson&#x2019;s Bay and, further in the distance, verdant Manly, the suburb on the northern side of the bay. To the east the horizon curved in a spectrum of various shades of blue. The cliffs plunged down in front of them, and way below the ocean breakers ended their long voyage in a thunderous crescendo among the rocks.<br><br>Harry felt a bead of sweat running down between his shoulder blades. This heat was giving him goose pimples.<br><br>&#x201c;You can see the Pacific Ocean from here, Harry. Next stop New Zealand, after about twelve hundred wet miles,&#x201d; Andrew said, spitting a thick gobbet off the edge of the cliff. They followed it down for a while until the wind dispersed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Good job she wasn&#x2019;t alive when she fell,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She must have hit the cliffs on the way down; there were large chunks of flesh torn from her body when they found her.&#x201d;</p><h2>Piano Adventures: Lesson Book Level 2B</h2><p>This level introduces cross-hand arpeggios and the full major scale in the keys of C, G, and F.

To provide an integrated, biblical treatment of the full range of marriage and family issues, the authors of <em>God, Marriage, and Family</em> examine what Scripture says about God's purposes for humans in their marriage and family interactions. Their examination covers the special issues stemming from marriage, childrearing, singleness, homosexuality, and divorce and remarriage. With study questions and points for further discussion, this book is a comprehensive yet concise resource for anyone seeking a Scriptural response to our culture's complex challenges to God's intentions for marriage and family.</p></p><p><p><strong>Andreas J.

Evangelicals who research, debate, teach, and counsel on gender, sex, marriage, and family will find it an endlessly useful resource. The easy mastery with which the author threads his way through forty years' special pleadings gives this compendium landmark significance, and I recommend it highly."<br>&#x2014;<strong>J. I. Packer</strong>, Professor of Theology, Regent College; author, <em>Knowing God</em></p><p>"A generation ago the most influential book on marriage for me was <em>God and Marriage</em> by Geoffrey Bromiley. Now I have been married over 35 years and have sons who are near where I was in their marriages. For them-and for a whole generation under assault on the meaning of marriage and family-I am now looking to Andreas K�stenberger's new and larger <em>God, Marriage, and Family</em> to do for this generation what Bromiley's book did for mine. Unlike Bromiley's book, K�stenberger's book takes on the challenges of the present explicitly. That is more necessary now than it was 25 years ago. The special value of this book lies again in its pervasive exposition of Scripture. We are adrift in a sea of speculation without this. I am thankful for the book. I plan to give it to my grown children."<br>&#x2014;<strong>John Piper</strong>, Pastor for Preaching and Vision, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Minneapolis</p><p>&#x201c;Anything Andreas K�stenberger publishes is worthy of attention. His international education and experience, his teaching career, and his Christian character make him an author to be read with both care and anticipation. You may not agree with all his conclusions, but you&#x2019;ll be better equipped for living and teaching about <em>God, marriage, and Family</em>. Sensible, balanced, and biblical, this is a sound and timely summary of the Bible&#x2019;s teaching on some of the most basic and yet controversial topics in today&#x2019;s world.

In an era when too many Christians listen more intently to television therapists than to the Bible on the question of the family, this could be one of the most significant books you ever read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Russell D. Moore</strong><strong>,</strong> Dean, School of Theology; Senior Vice President for Academic Administration; Associate Professor of Theology and Ethics, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;The book is wide-ranging and reflects mature judgment in interpreting Scripture and applying it to life.

This is an excellent book that deserves to be widely used.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Wayne Grudem</strong>, Research Professor of Bible and Theology, Phoenix Seminary, Phoenix, Arizona</p><p>&#x201c;This is a superb book&#x2014;the work of a gifted exegete whose feet are firmly planted in this world. God, Marriage, and Family addresses the daunting issues facing today&#x2019;s Christians regarding marriage, divorce, remarriage, sexuality, children, contraception, abortion, singleness, sex roles, and leadership with radical biblical fidelity and practicality.

Kent Hughes</strong>, Author, <em>Disciplines of a Godly Man</em>; Senior Pastor Emeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;This volume should be not only on the shelf of every pastor in this land, but also in the syllabus of every course on marriage and the family taught in Christian colleges and seminaries. The author&#x2019;s careful defense of traditional biblical values relating to family life demands a serious reading, especially by those who do not agree with him.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Daniel I. Block</strong>, Gunther H. Knoedler Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;Driven by a passion for Scripture and fueled by a sense of urgency borne out of the cultural wars that seek to hide and even destroy the biblical patterns, K�stenberger grapples with salient issues of interest to those who see the family as God&#x2019;s basic unit in his revelation of himself.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Paige and Dorothy Kelley Patterson</strong>, President and Professor of Theology in Women's Studies, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;The Christian looking for a brief, understandable, straightforward, intelligent, faithful presentation of what the Bible says about marriage, family, divorce, remarriage, homosexuality, abortion, birth control, infertility, adoption, and singleness need look no further.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>J. Ligon Duncan</strong>, Senior Minister, First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi; President, Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals</p><p>&#x201c;While many popular treatments of marriage and the family are available, very few have explored with care and precision Scripture&#x2019;s own teaching on these crucial subjects.

As Western society struggles to hold on to its social identity, this study reaffirms God&#x2019;s will for self-understanding and family ties. Readers seeking the whole counsel of God on these matters will find enormous assistance here.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Robert W. Yarbrough</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of New Testament, New Testament Department Chair, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p><p>&#x201c;The book is especially valuable because it is remarkably clear and comprehensible, while at the same time reflecting deep and responsible research.

Hugenberger</strong>, Senior Minister, Park Street Church, Boston</p><p>&#x201c;These days it is important for us to remember that God has something to say about marriage and family. With all of the competing voices insisting on new definitions and unbiblical patterns, K�stenberger has provided the Christian community with an invaluable resource.

The Battle of the Bulge was Hitler?s last chance to turn back the Allied invasion of France, which had started with D-Day. Hitler?s ambitious plans to force two Panzer armies through to take the vital port of Antwerp, separating the British and American forces could have resulted in a second Dunkrik. This would have bought him time to launch a full-scale assault on Britain with his ?miracle weapons?. A wide selection of contemporary voices, from diaries, letters, archives and eye witness accounts from all sides of the battle bring history to life. Collected here are the voices of soldiers, next to the formidable narratives of General Eisenhower, General Montgomery and Adolf Hitler, as well as the recollections of the civilians who stood witness to this piece of history.</p><p>Nigel de Lee has taught war studies at Sandhurst, Camberley, history at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis and Operations and Tactics at the Krigsskolen in Oslo as well as working for twenty years as an interviewer for the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive. He is currently teaching in the Politics Department at the University of Hull and is preparing to teach at the Joint Services Command and Staff College at Watchfield. He lives in Beverley, East Yorkshire.In its early stages, the 1944 German offensive was one of the few engagements where Americans faced the enemy with inferior forces and had to resort to the gritty defensive fighting that is the stuff of military epic. This absorbing collection vividly coveys the panic and pathos of the battle. Historian de Lee gathers excerpts from oral histories and memoirs of Allied and German soldiers along with period letters and war reporting, supplementing it with his own spare narrative of the offensive. Selections from the German viewpoint are underrepresented, and there is an excess of material on the British, who played a minor role in the battle and whose memories consist mostly of deploying, waiting and eating ("captured German pork and biscuits&#x2014;perfectly bloody!"). Also, the oral histories are entirely unedited and many are therefore incoherent and tedious. Fortunately, most of the selections are well chosen and convey both a harrowing view of combat and vivid period atmospherics. A soldier describes the terrified helplessness of a truckload of GI&#x2019;s brought suddenly under German fire; General McAuliffe issues his defiant "Nuts!" proclamation at the siege of Bastogne; a newspaper headline blares "GIs Fight Nazi Tanks Till Ground into Earth"; Stars and Stripes articles teach soldiers the do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts of fighting "trench foot" and defeating mud; a German soldier writes home, vowing to throw "the arrogant big-mouthed apes from the new world" into the ocean; and an American Red Cross woman writes poignantly of watching troops leave for the front at Christmas. The result is an illuminating panorama of the conflict. 30 b&amp;w photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She has taught and lectured in China, Japan, Mexico, England and India, and served as the head of the teacher-education initiative for the Teachers College/UNICEF Afghanistan Project. Illustrator Mike Bryce has a BA in fine arts and an MA in fine arts. He has taught art at many colleges and has illustrated for Houghton-Mifflin and Hallmark Cards. He lives in Rhode Island.As a bare introduction to Millay's poetry, this entry in the Poetry for Young People series is adequate, but should not be a substitute for other biographies or analyses of her work. Schoonmaker (Carl Sandburg, 1995) has written a four-page introduction to Millay's life before arranging a selection of more than 30 poems. In the narrative of Millay's childhood she includes many good details of her life at home (with a long explanation of her name, Vincent), but is silent on the topic of Millay's ``bohemian'' adult life, and more importantly, how the unconventional views of her poetry gave voice to the young generation of the roaring 20s. She reports that Millay's wealthy husband was a feminist, but not that Millay was, and offers no explanation of how her poetry reflected her strong convictions. In fact, although the book includes a good assortment of Millay's poetry, the format allows for almost no interpretation, particularly of the more ``adult'' poems that are include, e.g., ``First Fig,'' and ``Second Fig.'' Even if Schoonmaker chose not to venture into the charged territory of Millay's sexuality, there's no indication of how small verses such as these expressed in two lines the explosion of new freedoms for women. By placing the poems into safe, pastel-colored, greeting-card context, she leaves readers with a false portrait of who the poet was. (Poetry. 9-12) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

On the contrary, many have arisen from the highest aspirations of the human mind, the desire for a knowledge of eternal verities. The evils arising from such systems has usually consisted in the perversion of principles that were once pure and holy. <p>If I do not insist further on this point it is because a vast literature has already been devoted to the subject, so that it is only mentioned briefly here. <b>-A &amp; B Book Pub</b></p></p><p>Nesta Helen Webster (Mrs. Arthur Webster), (24 August 1876 &#x2013; 16 May 1960) was a controversial author who revived conspiracy theories about the Illuminati. She argued that the secret society's members were occultists, plotting communist world domination, using the idea of a Jewish cabal,[citation needed] the Masons and Jesuits as a smokescreen. According to her, their international subversion included the French Revolution, 1848 Revolution, the First World War, and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. In 1920, Webster was one of the contributing authors who wrote The Jewish Peril, a series of articles in the London Morning Post centred on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. These articles were subsequently compiled and published in the same year in book form under the title of The Cause of World Unrest.

Ebert&#x2019;s selections range widely across genres, periods, and nationalities, and from the highest achievements in film art to justly beloved and wildly successful popular entertainments. Roger Ebert manages in these essays to combine a truly populist appreciation for our most important form of popular art with a scholar&#x2019;s erudition and depth of knowledge and a sure aesthetic sense. Wonderfully enhanced by stills selected by Mary Corliss, film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, <i>The Great Movies </i>is a treasure trove for film lovers of all persuasions, an unrivaled guide for viewers, and a book to return to again and again.<br><br><i>The Great Movies</i> includes: <i>All About Eve � Bonnie and Clyde � Casablanca � Citizen Kane � The Godfather � Jaws � La Dolce Vita � Metropolis � On the Waterfront � Psycho � The Seventh Seal � Sweet Smell of Success � Taxi Driver � The Third Man � The Wizard of Oz</i> � and eighty-five more films.</p><p>If Pauline Kael popularized &#x201c;movie love,&#x201d; Roger Ebert is the eloquent Valentino of cinephiles. This invaluable volume gathers 100 of the Pulitzer winner's mini-essays composed since 1997, revised and updated, to form a love letter that could only spring from decades of devotion. A feat of superlative analysis, historical reflection, personal diary, and journalistic odyssey, <i>The Great Movies</i> combines an accessible style with an academic&#x2019;s precision. Accompanied by photos perfectly chosen by Museum of Modern Art film stills archivist Mary Corliss, the 100 films are irrefutably worthy of inclusion, allowing room for debate (John Ford&#x2019;s <i>My Darling Clementine</i> is in, <i>The Searchers</i> is not--arguably a wise decision) while placing each film into its own undeniable context of superiority. Admirably, Ebert recognizes that no critic writes in a vacuum; he dedicates the book to eight master critics hailed as &#x201c;teachers,&#x201d; quotes many of his contemporaries, and carries on the debate with Kael&#x2019;s lingering spirit (Ebert counters her on <i>Body Heat</i>, praises her on <i>Nashville</i>). His appreciation of <i>E.T.</i> is written as a letter to beloved children in his life, and the entire book breathes with an awareness of legacy--the cinema&#x2019;s and Ebert&#x2019;s own--that underlies the sobering theme of his introduction. We need these movies (and this book) to remind us that movies can be so much better than they typically are. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i><b>Roger Ebert</b> has been the film critic of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i>since 1967, and is the only film critic to have won a Pulitzer Prize.

She shares her home in South Carolina with her four dogs and a resident ghost named Mary Margaret.Bestseller Michaels's Sisterhood series (<i>Vendetta</i>, etc.) goes out with a bang and a wink as the Virginia vigilantes&#x2014;Myra, Kathryn, Alexis, Isabelle, Nikki and Anna&#x2014;seek justice for Yoko Akia, a young florist. Yoko wants to punish her father, who bought, impregnated and discarded her teenage mother, who died after giving birth to her. The lethal ladies are shocked to discover Yoko's dad is none other than Michael Lyons, an award-winning film star with another nasty secret: he's been buying and selling Asian women as sex slaves to prominent businessmen. The Sisterhood's fearless male cohorts, notably Myra's pal, Charles Martin, a former British secret agent, lend assistance, but in the end the female vigilantes must confront Lyons in L.A. on their own with two nosy reporters hot on their trail. Some industrial strength glue comes in quite handy.

Needlepoint was favoured both as a pastime and as a key decorative element and this book includes designs for cushions, rugs, chairseats, hangings, firescreens, a Charleston blotter and Virginia Woolf&#39;s glasses case. Stitch-by-stitch colour charts, yarn information and detailed instructions make it easy to recreate the spontaneity of the original tapestries and designs, and suggestions for alternative colourways are also given. Some of the designs are based on the murals and paintings rather than the tapestries and Melinda Cross takes a look at the recurring motifs of boats, shells, flowers and cherubs, many inspired by Charleston and its seaside location.

Then, when the dot-com bubble burst and the economy cooled, many assumed the war for talent was over. It's not. Now the authors of the original study reveal that, because of enduring economic and social forces, the war for talent will persist for the next two decades. McKinsey &amp; Company consultants Ed Michaels, Helen Handfield-Jones, and Beth Axelrod argue that winning the war for leadership talent is about much more than frenzied recruiting tactics. It's about the timeless principles of attracting, developing, and retaining highly talented managers - applied in bold new ways. And it's about recognizing the strategic importance of human capital because of the enormous value that better talent creates.Fortified by five years of in-depth research on how companies manage leadership talent - including surveys of 13,000 executives at more than 120 companies and case studies of 27 leading companies - the authors propose a fundamentally new approach to talent management. They describe how to: create a winning EVP (employee value proposition) that will make your company uniquely attractive to talent; move beyond recruiting hype to build a long-term recruiting strategy; use job experiences, coaching, and mentoring to cultivate the potential in managers; and, strengthen your talent pool by investing in A players, developing B players, and acting decisively on C players.Central to this approach is a pervasive talent mindset - a deep conviction shared by leaders throughout the company that competitive advantage comes from having better talent at all levels. Using practical examples from companies such as GE, The Home Depot, PerkinElmer, Amgen, and Enron, the authors outline five imperatives that every leader - from CEO to unit manager - must act on to build a stronger talent pool. Written by recognized authorities on the topic, this is the definitive strategic guide on how to win the war for talent.</p></p><p><i>Talent</i>, as defined by Ed Michaels, Helen Handfield-Jones, and Beth Axelrod, is shorthand for a key employee who possesses "a sharp strategic mind, leadership ability, communications skills, the ability to attract and inspire people, entrepreneurial instincts, functional skills, and the ability to deliver results." It's also, they contend in <i>The War for Talent</i>, an overarching personnel characteristic that companies of all kinds will require throughout their organizations in order to survive the competitive recruiting era that we appear to be entering. Michaels, Handfield-Jones, and Axelrod, authors of a 1997 McKinsey Quarterly article that uncovered a definitive connection between top performers and superior corporate achievement, spent the intervening years studying 13,000 executives in 27 companies to identify the programs and behaviors that help today's foremost firms attract and retain the best kinds of employees. The authors outline five common "imperatives" that they found these companies employed to strengthen their talent pools ("Embrace a Talent Mindset," "Craft a Winning Employee Value Proposition," "Rebuild Your Recruiting Strategy," "Weave Development into Your Organization," and "Differentiate and Affirm Your People") and construct a practical framework for making it happen in your company. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"The seminal book on the most significant problem facing all organizations." <br> -Warren Bennis, Distinguished Professor of Business, University of Southern California and Author of <i>Managing the Dream</i><p> </p><p>"The one resource your competitors cannot duplicate-perhaps the only one-is the pool of managerial talent you create and cultivate.

Trouble so bad that even his protector George may not be able to save him ...</p><p>John Steinbeck (1902-1968) is remembered as one of the greatest and best-loved American writers of the twentieth century. During the 1930s, his works included The Red Pony, Pastures of Heaven, Tortilla Flat, In Dubious Battle, and Of Mice and Men. The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939, earned him a Pulitzer Prize. In 1962, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for LiteratureGary Sinise&#39;s reading of John Steinbeck&#39;s Of Mice and Men is nothing short of magnificent. Moving effortlessly from an eloquent, understated narrative voice to each character&#39;s quite particular presence, Sinise demonstrates a true command of the medium. At times, Sinise is so convincing that one is hard-pressed to believe that a single reader could be responsible for so many varied characterizations. Thanks to such a skilled reading, this audio edition captures every nuance of Steinbeck&#39;s austere prose and the full power of the novel&#39;s tragic denouement. Top to bottom, it&#39;s a masterful retelling of an American classic. R.W.B.

Married six times, to several millionaires and even a count, Joyce had no discernible talent except self-promotion. A barber's daughter from Norfolk, Virginia, who rose to become a Ziegfeld Girl and, briefly, a movie star, Joyce was the precursor of the modern celebrity-a person famous for being famous. Her scandalous exploits-sping a million dollars in a week, conducting torrid love affairs with the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Walter Chrysler-were irresistible to the new breed of tabloid journalists in search of sensation and to audiences hungry for the possibilities her life seemed to promise.<br><br>Joyce's march across Broadway, Hollywood, and the nation's front pages was only slowed by the true nemesis of the glamour girl: old age. She died in 1957, alone and forgotten-until now. In prose as vibrant as its subject, Gold Digger brings to life the woman who singularly epitomized this confident and hedonistic era.<br></p><p>"I may be expensive," Peggy Hopkins Joyce (1893-1957) once remarked, apropos of the wealthy husbands she acquired and discarded so lightly, "but I deliver the goods." Such racy frankness made Joyce the darling of the newly powerful mass media during the 1920s. Though she was a Ziegfeld showgirl and made a few movies, she was essentially a new kind of celebrity, states Constance Rosenblum in this entertaining biography: "She did nothing of significance [but] Peggy was blessed with a profound understanding of the uses of publicity, not to mention an enormous hunger for its fruits." Rosenblum traces Joyce's trajectory from restless girlhood in the conservative South through her partying teens (she had been married twice by the age of 20) to the zenith of her fame as an icon of hedonistic Jazz Age glamour and the sad years of declining media attention and income cushioned by the judicious sale of jewels from former spouses. In this balanced appraisal, Joyce comes across as neither especially talented nor smart, but nonetheless oddly likable as she parlays her looks and charm into a life of comfort. "She knew what she wanted, went after it with her whole heart, and lived the life she yearned to live," Rosenblum concludes. "That is no small achievement, then or now." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Constance Rosenblum, a journalist at The New York Times, was for many years editor of the paper's Arts and Leisure section.

He lives in Seattle, Washington.<p><b>6. My Son Comes Out </b></p><p>A lot has changed since <i>The Kid</i>, my memoir about adopting our son, D.J., was published a dozen years ago. For starters, D.J. isn&#x2019;t an infant anymore. And no one sits at home by the phone waiting for a call from a hot guy he met at a dance club or a prospective employer or an adoption agency. Now our phones go wherever we do, in our pockets or (more likely) in our hands, practically a part of our bodies. But it wasn&#x2019;t that long ago that someone waiting for an important, potentially life-changing phone call would be afraid to leave the house.</p><p>What else has changed?</p><p>Our country, of course, and by extension the world&#x2014;whether the world liked it or not&#x2014;on 9/11. Two wars came but just one&#x2014;as of this writing&#x2014;has gone. Americans put an African-American in the White House. Twice. Republicans put an idiot Alaskan on the national stage. We saw advances on gay rights all over the world. Marriage rights were extended to same-sex couples in nine US states and the District of Columbia, as well as Spain, Argentina, the Netherlands, Canada, South Africa, and five other nations and counting. And now at least fifteen countries&#x2014;including most recently, France, under Socialist Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault&#x2014;have extended adoption rights to same-sex couples. When I wrote <i>The Kid</i>, Americans opposed full civil equality for gays and lesbians by wide margins. Today poll after poll shows that an ever-growing majority of Americans now support marriage rights for same-sex couples.</p><p>What else?</p><p>My boyfriend became my husband&#x2014;in Canada, first, where Terry and I got married on our tenth anniversary, and then in our home state of Washington, where voters passed marriage equality in 2012.</p><p>Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.</p><p>Kim Kardashian, Sinead O&#x2019;Connor, and Britney Spears got married.</p><p>Everyone I know got iPods, iPhones, and iPads.</p><p>Kim Kardashian, Sinead O&#x2019;Connor, and Britney Spears got divorced after seventy-two, sixteen, and two days of marriage, respectively.</p><p>My mother passed away.</p><p>Myspace passed away.</p><p>Steve Jobs passed away.</p><p>D.J.&#x2019;s mom, Melissa, is no longer living on the streets.</p><p>I wrote a couple of books, became the go-to guy for straight people in need of sex advice, and Terry and I founded the It Gets Better Project.</p><p>Nabisco introduced candy-corn-flavored Oreos.</p><br><br><p>Another big change: the number of gay couples adopting children in the United States exploded. In 2000, the same year <i>The Kid</i> was published, there were sixty-five hundred adoptions by gay American couples, according to a study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2009, nearly twenty-two thousand gay couples in the United States adopted children. This increase in the number of gay adoptive parents has been described as &#x201c;stratospheric.&#x201d;</p><p><i>The Kid</i> played a role in the gay-parenting boom. I get letters daily from gay men who were inspired to adopt after reading about how Terry and I became dads. Many of these men tell me that they had always wanted to be parents but that they had concluded fatherhood wasn&#x2019;t possible for them after they came out. Reading about our &#x201c;journey to parenthood,&#x201d; as social workers everywhere describe adoption, demystified the adoption process and helped them realize that they, too, could be parents. Because, hey, if they gave a kid to <i>those</i> guys&#x2014; that sex-advice columnist and his disc jockey boyfriend?&#x2014;who won&#x2019;t they give a kid to?</p><p>Anti-gay &#x201c;Christian&#x201d; activists oppose gay marriage, gay workplace protections, gay military service, and, as they&#x2019;ve made clear through their support of the fraudulent &#x201c;ex-gay&#x201d; movement, gay existence. So it comes as no surprise that they also oppose gay adoptions.</p><p>Opponents of gay marriage/employees/soldiers/adoptions/existence push one &#x201c;big lie&#x201d; to justify each item on their anti-gay agenda&#x2014; gay marriage will harm society, openly gay soldiers will destroy military readiness, gay people can choose to be straight, and so forth. (In fact, gay people have been marrying in Canada for more than a decade and Canada is doing just fine; a study by the Palm Center, formerly at the University of California and now independent, found that the repeal of the ban on openly gay soldiers has had &#x201c;no overall negative impact on military readiness, including cohesion, recruitment, retention, assaults, harassment, or morale&#x201d;; in 2012 the head of the largest &#x201c;ex-gay&#x201d; group in the country, Alan Chambers of Exodus International, admitted that his organization cannot &#x201c;cure&#x201d; homosexuality.)</p><p>The &#x201c;big lie&#x201d; advanced by opponents of gay adoption is this: When a selfish gay couple adopts, a loving heterosexual couple is deprived of a child. Children who could have been adopted by straight couples are being given to gay couples, they argue, and they claim that it&#x2019;s not just childless heterosexual couples who are being harmed. Children are being harmed.</p><p>In August of 2012 Bryan Fischer, a prominent anti-gay voice on the Christian right and the host of a widely listened to talk radio program, called for the creation of a new &#x201c;Underground Railroad&#x201d; that would &#x201c;deliver innocent children from same-sex households.&#x201d; Fischer is the director for issues analyses for the American Family Association and he exerts a powerful influence on Republican politics. And Fischer believes that children with gay parents should be <i>kidnapped</i> because getting your kids to school in the morning, making sure their homework is done, their teeth are brushed, that they have enough decent food to eat&#x2014;basic parenting responsibilities&#x2014;become &#x201c;a form of sexual abuse&#x201d; when same-sex couples perform them.</p><p>Children, according to Fischer and others on the right, need a mother and a father, and denying children two opposite-sex parents isn&#x2019;t just tantamount to child abuse. It is child abuse. For many years opponents of gay adoption have dishonestly cited studies that demonstrated the advantages of having two parents, not two parents of the opposite sex, to justify their opposition to adoptions by same-sex couples.</p><p>In 2012, a new study that seemed to support the anti-gay-parenting position was released. The study, authored by University of Texas sociologist Mark Regnerus, was funded by two anti-gay think tanks. Regnerus claimed that he was comparing outcomes for children raised by gay parents with children raised by straight couples. He wasn&#x2019;t. He was comparing children with married straight parents&#x2014; children from stable, intact homes&#x2014;to children from broken homes. The study has been widely debunked. (&#x201c;Among the problems with the study was the definition of &#x2018;lesbian mothers&#x2019; and &#x2018;gay fathers,&#x2019; &#x201d; reads a report in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>. &#x201c;A woman could be identified as a &#x2018;lesbian mother&#x2019; in the study if she had had a relationship with another woman at any point after having a child, regardless of the brevity of that relationship and whether or not the two women raised the child as a couple. . . . That fact alone in the paper should have &#x2018;disqualified it immediately&#x2019; from being considered for publication.&#x201d;) Only two young adults out of the 248 interviewed in the Regnerus study were raised from birth by same-sex couples.</p><p>Dozens of legitimate, sound studies of children with same-sex parents have demonstrated again and again that our kids on average are just as likely to be happy, healthy, and well-adjusted as children with opposite-sex parents. Case in point: UCLA released a study, published in October of 2012 in the <i>American Journal of Orthopsychiatry</i>, comparing (and tracking over time) children who were adopted out of foster care by gay men, lesbian women, and heterosexual couples. The study followed eighty-two Los Angeles County children, a quarter of whom were adopted by homosexual parents, and then followed up with them for two years after being placed. Researchers found that &#x201c;children in all three types of households benefited from adoption: on average, they made significant gains in cognitive development&#x2014;their IQ scores increased by an average of 10 points&#x2014;and they maintained stable levels of behavior problems. What&#x2019;s more, the kids adopted by gay and lesbian parents actually started out with more risk factors, and were more likely to be of a different ethnicity than their adoptive parents, but after two years were on equal footing with their heterosexually-adopted peers.&#x201d; Coauthor Letitia Anne Peplau concluded, &#x201c;There is no scientific basis to discriminate against gay and lesbian parents.&#x201d;</p><p>This study and the many others like it are supported by the reality that social workers, pediatricians, and family counselors nationwide see every day. Which is why mainstream child health and social services organizations unanimously support adoption by qualified gay parents. The American Academy of Pediatrics offers this endorsement of same-sex adoption: &#x201c;The Academy supports the legal adoption of children by [same-sex] coparents or second parents. Denying legal parent status through adoption to coparents or second parents prevents these children from enjoying the psychologic and legal security that comes from having two willing, capable, and loving parents.&#x201d;</p><p>Fischer&#x2019;s bigoted rants stoke the vilest form of anti-gay bigotry: The belief that gay people, and gay men in particular, prey on children. The religious right continues to promote the myth of the gay sexual predator&#x2014;gay people &#x201c;recruit&#x201d; by sexually abusing children&#x2014;but that lie is fast losing its toxic cultural currency. It simply isn&#x2019;t borne out by crime statistics (pedophiles are almost always straight-identified men, as Jerry Sandusky was, and they are attracted to children of both sexes, but they have easier access&#x2014;as coaches, for instance&#x2014;to same-sex victims) or by personal experience (most straight Americans know openly gay people now and the openly gay people they know aren&#x2019;t sexually abusing children). Anti-gay voices on the right are attempting to stuff the same old fears (gay people <i>prey on children</i>) into a brand-new bag (gay couples <i>steal children</i> from straight couples).</p><p>Gay couples aren&#x2019;t stealing children from straight couples. Even with more same-sex couples adopting children than ever before, there are <i>still</i> more children who need to be adopted than there are couples (or singles) who are willing to adopt them. The choice for children waiting to be adopted isn&#x2019;t between gay parents and straight parents. It&#x2019;s between parents and no parents. And as nearly half a million children languish in foster care across the United States, political organizations with the word <i>family</i> in their names spend millions of dollars every year lobbying for restrictions that would block many of those children from ever having families of their own.</p><br><br><p>Whenever someone asks me why the United States is such a mess about sex and everything that touches on sex&#x2014;why the United States, out of all Western industrialized nations, will never stop fighting about abortion, sex education, birth control, the sex lives of politicians, the existence of gay people&#x2014;I shrug and say, &#x201c;Canada got the French, Australia got the convicts, the United States got the Puritans.&#x201d; But, in one area, the United States isn&#x2019;t doing too badly when compared to lands that are braver, freer, and that have, every now and then, elected <i>actual</i> socialist heads of state. And that&#x2019;s in adoptions by same-sex couples. On this issue, and pretty much this issue alone, the United States leads. It is legal for same-sex couples to adopt jointly in eleven states; adoptions by single gay people are legal in forty-five states; and second-parent adoptions are legal in thirteen states. Same-sex couples who live in states where they can&#x2019;t adopt are free to do out-of-state adoptions in states where they can. Our relatively liberal adoptions laws weren&#x2019;t the result of an orgy of progressive, pro-gay legislation. In most states &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; adoption laws are something of a legislative oversight. Adoptions by same-sex couples and single gay people were never specifically <i>banned</i>, which allowed judges and social workers, their sights set on the best interests of children, to quietly approve adoptions by single gay people and same-sex couples.</p><p>Belgium, by way of comparison, created a &#x201c;statutory cohabitation&#x201d; law in 1998 that granted limited rights to same-sex couples. The country legalized same-sex marriage in 2003, but it wouldn&#x2019;t allow for adoptions by same-sex couples until 2006. Portugal granted same-sex couples limited rights in 2001 and legalized same-sex marriage in 2010. But same-sex couples in Portugal are still barred from adopting children. The same pattern has repeated itself in other European nations where gay people have secured their civil equality: First comes marriage&#x2014;or some form of marriage-lite (civil unions, domestic partnerships)&#x2014;then come gays pushing baby carriages.</p><p>Here in the United States we&#x2019;re doing it in reverse. Same-sex couples have been adopting&#x2014;and having children through surrogacy and artificial insemination, and raising children born to us in previous heterosexual relationships&#x2014;long before the marriage equality movement in the United States got off the ground. Same-sex couples that wanted to start families didn&#x2019;t wait for permission or marriage licenses. We created our families and trusted that the culture would catch up. And that&#x2019;s just what seems to be happening.</p><p>When President Obama announced his support for marriage equality in an interview on ABC News in May of 2012, he emphasized the gay parents he personally knew. (&#x201c;When I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly [committed] same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together . . . I&#x2019;ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.&#x201d;) If the gay men and lesbians who work for Barack Obama had waited for the president to endorse marriage equality before starting their families they never would&#x2019;ve started their families. Instead they met, fell in love, started families, and trusted that the culture&#x2014;to say nothing of the president they served&#x2014;would eventually recognize their humanity and affirm their basic human rights. The effort to bring gay families into the established social order&#x2014;the movement to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t about upending the traditional understanding of marriage. It&#x2019;s about recognizing new realities, and new kinds of families, and bringing these families inside our shared marriage tradition.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose marriage equality is socially liberal in as much as it tries to defend and integrate a previously despised minority,&#x201d; Andrew Sullivan writes. &#x201c;But it is socially conservative in its attempt to envelop that minority in the traditions and responsibilities of family life.&#x201d;</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Louise Pratt, a member of the Australian Senate, may have said it best, though. During a debate over a marriage amendment bill in September of 2012&#x2014;a bill that, had it not failed 26&#x2013;41, would have legalized same-sex marriage in that country&#x2014;Pratt, whose partner is transgendered, said this: &#x201c;We exist. We already exist. Our relationships exist, our children exist, our families exist, our marriages exist, and our love exists.

Her sisters included Lady Diana Mosley; Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire and Jessica, who immortalised the Mitford family in her autobiography Hons and Rebels. The Mitford sisters came of age during the Roaring Twenties and wartime in London, and were well known for their beauty, upper-class bohemianism or political allegiances. Nancy contributed columns to The Lady and the Sunday Times, as well as writing a series of popular novels including The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, which detailed the high-society affairs of the six Radlett sisters. While working in London during the Blitz, Nancy met and fell in love with Gaston Palewski, General de Gaulle&#39;s chief of staff, and eventually moved to Paris to be near him. In the 1950s she began writing historical biographies - her life of Louis XIV, The Sun King, became an international bestseller. Nancy completed her last book, Frederick the Great, before she died of Hodgkin&#39;s disease on 30 June 1973.&#34;Beautifully evokes the period&#34; * Independent on Sunday * &#34;Delightfully gossipy...irreverently lifts the skirts of the dolls of Versailles and rummages about underneath, exposing one gem of irresistible detail after another...A glorious tribute to a glorious age&#34; * Irish Times * &#34;La Mitford plonks the reader amid the seething snobbery and maniacal struggle for High Life that was the Sun King&#39;s regime... brilliantly acerbic&#34; * Observer * &#34;Her style is skilfully succinct; and her wit proceeds from uncommon shrewdness...readers will wish her her book were twice as long&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;Highly entertaining...written with her accustomed dash and gaiety, in a manner which frequently suggests one of her delightful novels...

He was reportedly Ian Fleming's model for James Bond. Adventurer, playboy, lover - his exploits are legend. Here in vivid, razor-sharp prose, Popov details his life as agent for the British while ostensibly working for the Nazis. Popov entered into the twilight world of espionage when he realized that only a concerted effort on the part of all freedom-loving men could help stop the menace of Fascism. Posing as an admirer of the Nazis, Popov managed to gain their confidence until he was a top spy. He passed on German information to British Intelligence. British General Petrie rated him as the man who single-handedly held up 7 to 15 German divisions during the opening of the second front. Popov's value to the British as a double-agent was not, however, appreciated by the FBI. When Popov was sent to the U.S. by the Germans, his welcome was less then cordial. Dusko's story of the advance notice of the intended bombing of Pearl Harbor, as well as his delivery of the micro-dot to the FBI, will galvanize the reader. His extreme courage and intelligence made Popov the most important double-agent in the Second World War. Again and again he risked his life with the Germans even though his "cover" might have been blown at any moment. He risked torture and death to establish German confidence in him so he could work for the destruction of the Third Reich.

Many had participated in A Day in the Life of Canada ( LJ 11/1/85) and the similar books on Australia and Hawaii. This, however, is the first such coverage of a non-Western, non-English-speaking country. The color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. The pictures are arranged chronologically, from early morning until late at night. A map of Japan shows where each was taken.

Celebrated artists include Basil Besler, Maria Sybilla Merian, Mark Catesby, Georg Ehret, George Brookshaw, Robert John Thornton, Pierre Joseph Redout�, and many others. Illustrated with over 300 full-color images of original and valuable botanical prints, this book fills a void in the literature, as few good botanical references remain in print. The text recounts the fascinating lives and passions of the artists and their patrons, the technical advances in printmaking, and the history and cultural influences that shaped the depiction of flowers, plants, and trees. Also discussed are many variables affecting the values of original antique botanical prints including condition, rarity, historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. A range of prices is included to guide you in your collecting and a section on framing, displaying, and proper storage makes this an indispensable reference. A fascinating book for collectors of botanical prints, gardeners, and those interested in the history of flowers.</p><p>Denise DeLaurentis has been a dealer of fine antique prints for over twenty years, operating a gallery in Philadelphia.

However, this Bible has also left a trail of pain. It is undeniable that the Bible is not always used for good. Sometimes the Bible can seem overtly evil. Sometimes its texts are terrible. </p><p>Bishop John Shelby Spong boldly approaches those texts that have been used through history to justify the denigration or persecution of others while carrying with them the implied and imposed authority of the claim that they were the "Word of God." As he exposes and challenges what he calls the "terrible texts of the Bible", laying bare the evil done by these texts in the name of God, he also seeks to redeem these texts, hoping to recover their ultimate depth and purpose. Spong looks specifically at texts used to justify homophobia, anti-Semitism, treating women as second-class humans, corporal punishment, and environmental degradation, but he also delivers a new picture of how Christians can use the Bible today. As Spong battles against the way the Bible has been used throughout history, he provides a new framework, introducing people to a proper way to engage this holy book of the Judeo-Christian tradition.</p></p><p>In the <i>Sins of Scripture</i>, Bishop John Shelby Spong takes on a thematic exploration of the Bible, carefully analyzing those passages that inform some of our key debates, like the role of women in the church and in society, and homosexuality, to name just two.&nbsp; Beyond that he also looks at scriptures that have helped shape culture and history -- bringing to light the undercurrent of anti-Semitism he finds in the Gospels, for example.&nbsp; The journey is particularly compelling because Bishop Spong believes in and values the good the Bible has brought to many through the ages.&nbsp; His goal is not to define the Bible itself as something to be set aside, but instead to honor and value what he loves about it while still labeling what he dramatically calls "texts of terror" for what they are. <p>The true joy of the book is found in Spong's vigorous intellect, which he shines bright in an attempt to catch a reflection of the age, culture and circumstances in which the texts he examines were written.&nbsp; Like an archaeologist working with ideas instead of tools, he removes the rocks, brushes away the sediment and reports on what he finds.&nbsp; What were the roots and cultural realities behind the Scriptures that define the role of women in the church?&nbsp; What were the hopes and fears driving the writers who condemned homosexuality in such stark terms?&nbsp; What is the justification behind scriptures recommending "the rod of correction" (or as Bishop Spong simply labels it: "[t]he physical abuse of children...".) </p><p>Whether or not you agree with some of his musings along the way, many of his conclusions are hard to argue with.&nbsp; Putting aside the issue of divine origin of the Bible, no one can deny passages have been used in service of very human ends.&nbsp; Finally, the Sins of Scriptures can be seen as a careful observer of what those ends have been.&nbsp; And when taken on those terms, it makes an interesting read, regardless of one's religious background.--<i>Ed Dobeas</i></p><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world.

A young boy, Mike, tells of his family's struggle to keep its farm going through another difficult year. The lo cal school has closed, milk and crop prices are down, and the boy's father is forced to take a factory job in town to make it through the winter. Mike's sis ter suggests expanding their mother's pumpkin and flower garden into full farm production. The financially suc cessful experiment allows the farm to continue for at least one more year. Mike's unadorned prose tells a very personal story, at the same time intro ducing children to the tenuous state of the family farm. While the text may be understated, Locker's oil landscapes are a true celebration of the strength, glory, and tradition of rural America. His now-familiar striking use of color and light is especially effective in scenes of the changing seasons spring's and summer's vibrant greens and yellows, autumn's rich browns and oranges and winter's icy grays and blues. Unfortunately, most real life farm stories won't have this hopeful an ending, but Locker's story and art are a well deserved tribute to this threatened life.

But here, you'll find the format greatly simplified into 10 short chapters, each with a single focus. Each step is fairly basic and combines visualisation and breathing exercises with the behaviour modifications we've come to expect when we try to get healthier, such as more exercise, balanced eating, avoidance of toxins and regular sleep. Clear diagrams are included when necessary--with his yoga stretches and breathing exercises, for example--and tables have been provided for a quick glance at some recommendations for vitamins. A handful of internationally inspired vegetarian recipes are tucked in the back and are a fun way to introduce some unusual flavours to your meals. <p> A regular complaint about Chopra's books is the lack of clear data to back up his claims, and this has not changed. He provides numerous anecdotal accounts of people ridding themselves of cancer, AIDS or high blood pressure. For many lay readers, these anecdotes provide enough encouragement to try Chopra's program and improve their outlook on life; medical professionals may just be annoyed by them. Lack of research aside, it's hard to argue with the suggestions. From "connecting more openly with your co-workers" to "always use sunscreen when you are outdoors" and "drink plenty of fresh water throughout the day", the majority of Chopra's methods seem based in common sense, with his "Quantum Realm" as the seasoning that adds a little exciting flavour to a very basic recipe. --<i>Jill Lightner</i></p>Deepak Chopra and David Simon provide the reasons to see old age as both a mind-set and a recipe for breaking its hold on us.

Though I haven&#x2019;t taken a survey, I&#x2019;d imagine that a good number of the guest editors of all the Best American series have felt compelled to take issue with it, too. To presume that my personal taste de- fines an objective by which all living cartoonists should be judged is absurd. On top of that, any public competition is antithetical to the spirit of real art, and labeling a widely disseminated collection of artwork as the best&#x201d; veers perilously close to suggesting that artists should gauge what they do against some sort of popularity contest for an ancillary reward notoriety, money, or even inclusion in an anthology other than the artwork itself. So while I suppose it&#x2019;s probably obvious to the reader that my name as guest editor essentially acts as a sort of aesthetic loophole for the overall series title, it still seems polite and proper to acknowledge it here. In some cases I&#x2019;ve chosen stories or excerpts of stories that fulfill what I think I&#x2019;m regularly looking for from art and literature (which, when boiled down past all the things that don&#x2019;t really matter like a snazzy style and clever writing and accomplished drawing, means telling the truth&#x201d;). I&#x2019;ve also included work that has stuck in my craw to such a degree that the best I can do is to say that it&#x2019;s interesting, or, in a more conversational way, that it&#x2019;s made me feel really, really old.<br> As a cartoonist myself, I&#x2019;ve been quite heartened at the veritable explosion of intriguing work in a medium that as recently as a decade ago seemed marginal and embarrassing. In fact, it has almost gotten to the point now where a cartoonist doesn&#x2019;t have to explain or qualify what he or she does, let alone not have to launch into a thumbnail history of comics as a commercial-cum-artistic medium to family members at Christmastime. Comics are appearing in bookstores as novels and in museums as art. Even more amazing is that this is all because there really does appear to be a concomitant general increase in interest by the public, one of the most tangible bits of evidence being the very book you now hold.<br> Even the Newspaper of Record,&#x201d; long proud of its comic-strip-free pages, has gotten into the game. Aside from introducing a regular weekly feature in its magazine pages wherein a single cartoonist is invited to serialize his or her latest graphic novel for approximately thirty weeks (and, it should be noted, where Jaime Hernandez&#x2019;s full color La Maggie La Loca&#x201d; appeared, inclusion of which in this anthology was precluded by its upcoming collection in a comprehensive art book, despite my editorial wishes), dignified reviews of comics and graphic novels now regularly appear in the New York Times book review pages. But for all this general and encouraging bonhomie, the opinions expressed are not always rah-rah; in a June 2006 roundup of various recent comics in the Times, the reviewer expressed a certain weariness at the creeping sameness&#x201d; to much of what he was leafing through, semi- or wholly autobiographical sketches of drifting daily life and its quiet epiphanies.&#x201d; Admittedly, as comics have entered their late adolescence as art/literature, a preponderance of autobiographical work has accrued, beginning with the 1960s and 1970s comics of Justin Green, Aline Kominsky (now Kominsky-Crumb), Harvey Pekar, and, of course, Robert Crumb himself. Art Spiegelman has eloquently expressed the difficulty of understanding both the value of and the means to approaching fiction in his recent Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@#*!&#x201d; and the three generations of artists C. Tyler, Joe Matt, and Jeffrey Brown have, at least up until now, devoted their oeuvres almost solely to soul-searching self-analyses. I genuinely think that this is a necessity, however, both for the artists and the medium. As cartoonists and comics still attempt to acquaint themselves with not only how to express real human emotion but also try to decide exactly what human emotions are worth expressing, the most facile and immediate way to do it is to write about oneself. Charges of self-indulgence and navel- gazing are inevitable, especially for an artist maturing within an insulated and comparatively worry-free culture such as America&#x2019;s, but isn&#x2019;t art at least partly a means of finding a way out of oneself and then reporting back? The value of trying to see and feel one&#x2019;s own experience is a necessary step toward understanding what communicates and works in a medium, as well as an important bridge to cross toward completely synthetic, or imaginary, storytelling, should any artist want to cross it. (Though things really aren&#x2019;t that different over there, other than the grass is a bit greener or at least it is if you want it to be.) So in the first part of this anthology there are a number of biographical and autobbbbbiographical selections, ranging from C. Tyler&#x2019;s heartbeat-skipping Once, We Ran&#x201d; to the ideogrammatically immolating couch-time of Ivan Brunetti with everything in between. For myself, I genuinely think that one of the real responsibilities of an artist and writer (or, more properly, what I look for in writing and art myself) is a clear, honest communication of what it feels like to be alive to people who haven&#x2019;t been born yet. There&#x2019;s a unique emotional rudder that literature and art can provide to a consciousness drifting through life not something as banal as a roadmap or a rule book but a sort of sympathetic rut in the road. And whether that rut is real or imaginary, life is a lot harder to get through without it.<br> Without tilling too much of the same ground that I always seem to turn over whenever I try to write about comics as a medium, I should reiterate that cartooning takes a really, really long time and is hard, lonely work. Pages upon hundreds of pages are drawn and thrown away before any writer or artist eventually finds him- or herself. The reader may even reliably calculate that the time it takes to read a comic strip story to the time it took to draw it is roughly 1:1,000, and I&#x2019;m not exaggerating. At the same time, if any art is to endure, the effort expended on its creation is usurped (and one hopes eventually dwarfed) by the work&#x2019;s lasting power. For example, it takes a few days to read War and Peace, which took Tolstoy a few years to write, but it has survived and grown exponentially in strength through many generations of readers. Being so faced with eternity, at some point the artist, writer, or cartoonist has to somehow allow his or her work, for lack of any better metaphor, to take on a life of its own a necessary step that admits instinct, uncertainty, or faith into the act of creation what is frequently referred to as taking a risk&#x201d; in art. Sometimes this yielding can lead to complete failure, other times it can lead to something much larger. I think that in comics it&#x2019;s a necessary step in the regular creative process, and, from the works collected in this volume, it&#x2019;s something that appears to be happening more and more. The traditional, commercially established mode of scripting&#x201d; a story and then simply illustrating it does not admit to the endemic potential in comics to literally imagine and see on the page, to say nothing of plumbing areas of imagination and memory that, I think, would otherwise be left inaccessible to words or single pictures alone.<br> Art in the twentieth century (at least in the West) all but stomped out the idea of storytelling in pictures. Before that, a narrative, whether religious, military, or mythological, practically formed the raison d&#x2019;etre for visual art&#x2019;s existence. Altarpieces, through repeated sequential images, told the story of the Stations of the Cross, and giant tapestries and paintings recounted battles and victories for citizens and subsequent generations to admire and fear. But as the notion of art as essentially conceptual sprouted and eventually grew all over the previous century&#x2019;s museum walls and museum-goers&#x2019; eyes, paintings or drawings that showed something&#x201d; were increasingly dismissed as sentimental, or, even worse, illustrative.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a certain logic to this, especially if the urge is toward reducing a medium to its absolute barest skin-and-bones essentials in an attempt to discover its innate truth. Unfortunately, the truth of painting and drawing is that they&#x2019;re actually really great for showing things. (Music, on the other hand, isn&#x2019;t; think of how clunky and disturbing a concrete sound like a car horn is when introduced into a melody line that otherwise seems to be perfectly capturing the ebb and flow of the heart; I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s wrong to think that certain art forms might be better at one thing or another.) Comics, on the third hand (and at about the same time all of this was in full swing in the world of visual art), were showing things, lots of things: rape, murder, and other violence so much so that in the 1950s comic books were forced to self-censor as activist Fredric Wertham suggested that the corruption of American youth could be directly traced to such pictured acts of horror (the story of which, incidentally, is lyrically illuminated in Art Spiegelman&#x2019;s as-of-yet-unproduced opera Drawn to Death). Because of the traditionally narrative basis of the language in which they work, cartoonists are almost always cornered into showing something.&#x201d; And how lucky we&#x2019;ve been! And how lucky painters have been, too, ironically appropriating comic book imagery for decades because it was one of the few permitted territories for visual representation that the art world could stomach, sort of a cake and eat it too&#x201d; approach. (I, for one, am actually glad they let me eat cake, even if I had to choke down a little theory with it.) Ironically, while intellectually dismantling the reasons that people made pictures in the first place, art historians and art theoreticians also fell all over themselves telling us that we lived in an increasingly media-saturated world, an imagecentric, visually overstuffed, nonverbal, and distracted commercial culture barely able to discern what was real from what was advertised, and I guess to a certain degree they were right; I grew up with a mind snot-packed full of camera-cropped visions of superheroes and spaceships, and it&#x2019;s taken me a number of years of school and adulthood to blow my brains free of them all. Additionally, the narrative techniques of filmmaking have in- filtrated our consciousness to the degree that we now dream in crosscuts, close-ups, and long shots. We think nothing of zooming in on something in a photograph or a drawing, slicing off arms and legs and even ears as a way of simulating the focus of consciousness and how our minds categorize and order information. But is this really the best, or even the most accurate, way to reflect how we see&#x201d; the world? I&#x2019;m certainly no scientist or perceptual researcher, though I think I can say with a fair degree of certainty that the human invention of language evolved as a means of speedily ordering experience, allowing us to collect and organize the wash of perceptual muck that enters our senses into categorizable and reasonably consistent generalities, all as a means for quick action. Without delving too far into didactic nattering any further than I&#x2019;ve already allowed myself, this distinction is more or less what comics are: a language of abbreviated visual words&#x201d; having its own grammar, syntax, and punctuation.<br> I recently came across a very odd but captivating idea in the introduction to a new edition of a collection of Alexander Pushkin&#x2019;s short stories, in which the author, discussing the rise of prose in Russia as contrasted with that of England, suggested that seventeenth-century Elizabethans (who were, I infer, isolated and essentially rural) thought and spoke mainly in poetry. By the eighteenth century, however, poetry had surrendered to the more blunt clarity of prose, finally culminating in an increasingly urban and industrial nineteenth century, where Victorians talked in fiction.&#x201d;* The idea that as geography, communication, and society became more tight-knit, individual perceptions and expression began to standardize seems oddly credible to me, despite its broad sweep. And this is more or less exactly the inverse of what&#x2019;s been happening in comics for the last few years. As a medium that was locked into a fairly rigid set of storytelling strictures by a commercial system that encouraged production over insight, the basic balloon over picture&#x201d; trope hadn&#x2019;t changed for decades. But even a casual flip-through of the pages of this book will demonstrate a highly individual approach by each and every artist, all with the aim of getting at something new or, more precisely, real. I&#x2019;ve said this a few times before, but I wholeheartedly believe that comics are one of the more alive arts currently extant. I eagerly anticipate the newest publications by my favorite cartoonists not only because I love their work, but also so I can see what new approaches to storytelling they&#x2019;ve discovered that I can steal. With the recent rise of self-revelatory comics have come a requisite experimentation and pushing forward of the means of expression available to every artist, to say nothing of younger cartoonists no longer having to begin with the stone tools of superhero comics to try and chip out a personal story. (If this isn&#x2019;t the definition of a living language, then I don&#x2019;t know what is.) Sometimes this experimentation can be as straightforward as grafting a naturalistic or literary sensibility to the traditional mode of cartooning and sometimes it can be a complete reassessment of what comics really are, whether illustrated text, a symbolic language, or a series of uncertainly linked and expressively limned drawings. The younger generation, especially, seems to have taken this latter notion and developed it to such a degree that it leaves a creaky, brittle thinker like myself sitting on the edge of the dance floor, earnestly trying to find the beat. In short, I think this is absolutely great. A few years ago I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that comics could sustain such wrenching around, but I&#x2019;m delighted to see that as a medium it seems to hold up just fine. The cartoonist Gary Panter has to be given credit more than anyone for this change, in the 1970s and 1980s inventing a new way of visual storytelling that articulated and highlighted the emotional shifts of experience with a pen- on-paper pithing out of synaesthetic sensations of memory into an inseparable alchemy of poetry, calligraphy, and vision that leaves a reader reeling. I think it&#x2019;s fair to opine that he&#x2019;s also single-handedly paved the way for an entirely new generation of artists. Two of the more individual ones are the art collective Paper Rad&#x201d; and C.F., and they appear in this anthology. Whereas for decades it has been the tacit aim of most cartoonists to present a series of pictures that are consistently and clearly linked visually, many of the younger artists make no such concession, allowing for very strange yet oddly real associations and feelings that, to me, are disconcertingly freeing, especially when compared to more conventional and, for lack of a better word, theatrical comics. Reading their work and then returning to a more familiar type of comics is sort of like listening to Louis Armstrong and a Sousa march back-to-back. Personally, I suffered the very traumatizing experience of reading a large chunk of this material and then returning to my drawing table to suddenly sense a great deficit and lack of internal life to my rigid schemata. Like I mentioned earlier: it makes me feel old.<br> At the same time, a number of cartoonists whom I admire and deeply respect state with relative certainty that a comic strip without a solid, easily grasped story or explicit moral conflict between characters is not worthy of either reading or writing. I guess I...</p><h2>Manifest Your Destiny: Nine Spiritual Principles for Getting Everything You Want, The</h2><p><p><strong>From the inspirational leader and author of the international bestsellers&nbsp;<em>Your Sacred Self</em>&nbsp;and <em>Your Erroneous Zones</em>&nbsp;comes this mind-awakening guidebook for making your desires reality.</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Wayne Dyer is an extraordinary sensor of what people want and he moves with the ever-changing times.

Yet their mostly undeserved reputation for being difficult to grow has kept them from being known and appreciated by the vast majority of gardeners. By presenting detailed history, distribution, habitat, and observations on cultivation for each species, Mary Gerritsen and Ron Parsons aim to raise awareness of these gems of the American West and to bring them into wider horticultural use. The superb photographs, most taken in situ, vividly illustrate the remarkable variation within the genus and sometimes even within species.</p><p>Anyone who grows these dazzling gems will be enslaved by their beauty.Mary E. Gerritsen, PhD is also the author of <i>Masdevallias</i> (Timber Press 2005).

This short biography sympathetically describes her personal and public life as a middle-class Jewish outsider, crippled from childhood, her numerous writings and several love affairs. Brilliant and courageous, yet inflexible, intolerant and uncompromising, she was also insecure, romantic and sentimental. She was often imprisoned for her radical views and activities. Luxemburg tried to establish a proletarian government in Germany, but she and her associates were murdered by reactionary soldiers shortly after the armistice. Ettinger's intimate book does not replace Peter Nettl's standard, more comprehensive biography of 1966. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ettinger provides a personal, well-written portrait of Luxemburg. Her study does not attempt either a comprehensive analysis of Luxemburg's political writings, or a "definitive" biography of the famed international socialist. Instead, Ettinger explores emotional roots, Luxemburg's Polish-Jewish origins in Zamosc and Warsaw, and her relationship with Leo Jogiches, the great love of her life, with whom she lived in common-law marriage for 15 years. One must read this as a complement to J.P. Nettl's two-volume biography of Luxemburg (1966). It draws a vibrant picture of the woman, essential to an understanding of the revolutionary. Occasional excesses in tone do not weaken the essential value of the work. Recommended for college and large public libraries. Sheila R.

Forrest's only friends are his pet raven, his father's prisoners (who all end up dead), and Ned, the young rat catcher. Soon Forrest's father gets a new prisoner: Maddie, the beautiful daughter of a Scottish spy. Immediately Forrest and Maddie become friends. But when she is slated for execution, Forrest must make some painful choices: Should he commit treason to help her escape, or obey the law and let his innocent friend be hung?</p><p>The bestselling author of GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SOCKS and THE RAVENMASTER&#39;S SECRET, Woodruff has written more than twenty books for children, including picture books, historical fiction, and lighthearted fantasy. Her numerous school visits each year are popular with kids and teachers. The sequel to GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SOCKS, GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SPY, will be published in November 2010. She lives with her family in Martin&#39;s Creek, Pennsylvania.Grade 5-8-Eleven-year-old Forrest is the son of the Ravenmaster in the Tower of London. Historically, this position, which fell to one of the Tower guards, was to care for the ravens that live within the walls of the fortress as a token of luck to keep it from falling to its enemies. Forrest has grown up in the Tower and has his own pet raven, Tuck. He feels confined and sheltered from the outside world. Bullies make fun of him. When dangerous Scottish rebels are captured and imprisoned, he hopes to show his bravery. His responsibility, however, turns out to be to take food to the young daughter of one of the rebels. As he learns more about Maddy, he comes to admire and respect her, and realizes that if he does not help her escape, she will be executed. To do so, though, he will have to go against all he has been taught. The story has its share of suspense, excitement, and interesting characters. Set in 1735, it does not flinch from describing the brutality of the time, including public hangings, which Forrest's mother loves to attend. While some of the plot elements may seem unrealistic and the ending too pat, the story is certainly satisfying. Its message of judging people on their own merits and not on the basis of stereotypes comes across strongly. An author's note, a history of the Tower of London, and a glossary of unfamiliar English and Scottish words are appended.<br><i>Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The expected trajectory is one of decline: volume 1, rise; volume 2, fall. Bellow never fell, producing some of his greatest fiction (<i>Mr Sammler's Planet</i>, <i>Humboldt's Gift</i>, all his best stories), winning two more National Book Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, and the Nobel Prize. At eighty, he wrote his last story; at eighty-five, he wrote <i>Ravelstein.</i> In this volume, his life away from the desk, including his love life, is if anything more dramatic than in volume 1. In the public sphere, he is embroiled in controversy over foreign affairs, race, religion, education, social policy, the state of culture, the fate of the novel. <br><br>Bellow's relations with women were often fraught. In the 1960s he was compulsively promiscuous (even as he inveighed against sexual liberation). The women he pursued, the ones he married and those with whom he had affairs, were intelligent, attractive and strong-willed. At eighty-five he fathered his fourth child, a daughter, with his fifth wife. His three sons, whom he loved, could be as volatile as he was, and their relations with their father were often troubled.<br><br>Although an early and engaged supporter of civil rights, in the second half of his life Bellow was angered by the excesses of Black Power. An opponent of cultural relativism, he exercised great influence in literary and intellectual circles, advising a host of institutes and foundations, helping those he approved of, hindering those of whom he disapproved. In making his case, he could be cutting and rude; he could also be charming, loyal, and funny. Bellow's heroic energy and will are clear to the very end of his life. His immense achievement and its cost, to himself and others, are also clear.</p><p><p>ZACHARY LEADER is professor of English literature at the Uni�versity of Roehampton in London.

Alfred Kazin was among the guests at the launch, and while waiting for his wife to arrive he amused himself by picking out &#x201c;the customers for Saul&#x2019;s party from the regulars at 21 was so easy!&#x201d; The regulars were better looking, stamped with the difference of their background deeply depressing. In they came, &#x201c;Arabel Porter all the old loves, would-be loves, friends and misses&#x2014;even Vassiliki [Rosenfeld]. All so stale, isn&#x2019;t bloody familiar?&#x201d; Only Bellow impressed:<br><br><i>Saul, our plebeian princeling and imaginative king, standing there, gray, compact, friendly and aloof, receiving his old friends whom he had invited to 21 . . . Saul alone of all the old gang has achieved first-class status. . . . Saul alone has made it, with the furious resistance of personal imagination to the staleness of the round. There&#x2019;s more yet for me, he cries in his heart, more, much more! Nothing is stale, he cries, if only you look at it hard enough, see in it aspects of human fate in general. Put your story on the universal stage of time, and the old Chicago friends will seem as interesting as kings in the old history books.</i><br><br> Two days earlier, when the first reviews of<i> Herzog </i>appeared, Kazin had pondered Bellow&#x2019;s public persona. The face he presented to the world, Kazin decided, resembled Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s &#x201c;in that first photograph of the tramp&#x2014;the face absolutely open to life, open, humble, almost childlike, in its concentrated wistfulness and na�ve expectancy. Above all a face submissive to the fates.&#x201d; This face, Kazin imagined, was worn by Herzog, and &#x201c;Saul himself now wears [it] in company. He sits in the waiting room, prepared to be ushered into anything. What will you do with me? he asks, recognizing a stronger power than himself.&#x201d; Kazin admired Bellow&#x2019;s air of containment, expectancy, passivity, but also found it irritating. &#x201c;Saul now wears an aspect mild and submissive,&#x201d; he writes in a journal entry of September the book was published. &#x201c;He puts his ear willing to anything to say to him. He is available to you, he is interested in you, he is most polite. But the minute he has registered what turns it into food for thought&#x2014;and you find yourself sacrificing&nbsp;<i>your</i> thought for the pleasure of having him develop it. Later, in a journal entry of August 1, 1965, Kazin complains of &#x201c;Saul&#x2019;s usual trick of having others make the effort, his immobility in company. . . . Saul is in an interesting state of self-consciousness, of course, because of his present fame and fortune. Having worked so long to make it, he now is suffering even more than usual because he has. He intimated, making almost a physical point of it as usual, that he sought anonymity. . . . He was, as usual, making mental lassos of everyone to himself. And I was tired of adjusting to him.&#x201d;<br><br> Within a month of publication, <i>Herzog</i> was number one on the best-seller list, supplanting John le Carr�&#x2019;s <i>The Spy Who Came In from the Cold</i>. Money began rolling in. New American Library purchased the paperback rights to<i> Dangling Man and The Victim</i> for $77,000 and Fawcett paid $371,350 for the paperback rights to <i>The Adventures of Augie</i> <i>March</i> and Herzog. &#x201c;Guys, I&#x2019;m rich,&#x201d; Mitzi McClosky remembers Bellow declaring. &#x201c;What can I get for you? Can I buy you something? Do you need any money?&#x201d; On October 30, Sam Goldberg, his lawyer friend, wrote to Bellow to ask what he should do about the manuscript of <i>Augie</i>. &#x201c;I am sitting with a $25,000 manuscript. I have no safe here which can hold it. . . . Are you going to dispose of the manuscripts this year or are you saving it for 1965&#x201d;&#x2014;for tax purposes, that is. On November 18, Bellow received an invitation from Mark Schorer, of the English Department at Berkeley, to teach one course for one semester and deliver two public lectures, for a fee of 12,000 dollars. He turned it down. In December, he donated the <i>Augie</i> and <i>Henderson </i>manuscripts to the University of Chicago and turned down a 5000 dollar award from <i>The Kenyon Review</i>, in both cases because of taxes. He donated Tivoli, the ramshackle house he&#x2019;d bought in 1956, to nearby Bard College, including the household contents: washing machine, refrigerator, walnut dining table, hi-fi, garden furniture, gas rotary lawn mower, garden tools. Meanwhile, the University of Chicago raised his salary to 20,000 dollars. Henry Volkening, his agent, negotiated offers for the film rights to <i>Henderson</i> (as did Sam Freifeld, to Volkening&#x2019;s consternation). &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t laugh,&#x201d; wrote Volkening to Bellow on March 24, 1965, &#x201c;but Peter Sellers is among the other stars with whom it is being discussed.&#x201d; There were also inquiries about <i>Herzog</i>. Robert Bolt, Richard Burton, and Fred Zinnemann were interested in filming the novel; Zinnemann suggested that Harold Pinter write the screenplay.<br><br> Bellow was kept advised of all these matters in lengthy, at times weekly, letters from Volkening. Throughout the 1960s, he himself was advising foundations and institutes: Yaddo, the Rockefeller, the Guggenheim, the Longview (from Texas, administered by Harold Rosenberg), the Ford, the Salk, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the Peace Corps, the Princeton University Department of Philosophy. On January 21, 1965, Volkening wrote to Philip Heller of Heller, Strauss and Moses, a Chicago accounting firm, listing payments made to Bellow in 1964 (royalties, serial rights, foreign rights, movie options, etc.). They amounted to $121,682.91 gross and $109,447.22 net. His 1966 tax return reported income of $140,000 (estimated by James Atlas at &#x201c;about $800,000 in today&#x2019;s terms&#x201d;), a figure nearly matched in the returns for 1967 and 1968. On February 19, 1965, Bellow wrote to the poet Stanley Burnshaw about his newfound prosperity: &#x201c;In my simplicity I thought the noise of <i>Herzog</i> would presently die down, but it seems only to get louder. I can&#x2019;t pretend it&#x2019;s entirely unpleasant. After all, I wanted something to happen, and if I find now that I can&#x2019;t control the volume I can always stuff my ears with money.&#x201d; In March 1965, <i>Herzog</i> won the National Book Award, which Bellow had previously won for <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>. Also in March, Volkening and Denver Lindley, of Viking, put Bellow up for membership in the Century Association. As money, honors, and front- page profiles accumulated, even his brother Maury took notice. &#x201c;The kid finally did it,&#x201d; he declared. On November 15, 1964, at the end of a typed single-spaced letter devoted to money and business, Henry Volkening apologized and offered advice and reassurance. &#x201c;Adjustment to success, though less harrowing than adjustment to shall we say figuring out how to &#x2018;get along,&#x2019; does nevertheless pose its problems, does it not? But look, I know how these things distract you from things you want to think about. . . . And I&#x2019;ll do my level best to minimize them, and have them be a benefit.&#x201d;<br><br> Money and its management were distractions for Bellow, but they were also ways of connecting to his brothers and sister. Now Bellow could enter into family business discussions&#x2014;if not as an equal, at least as a participant. Volkening cautioned Bellow against getting involved in the market (&#x201c;You have earned all of this big money the hard way,&#x201d; he wrote on May 19, 1965; &#x201c;it is very much easier to lose money than to increase it&#x201d;), but when Bellow began to dabble, he put him in touch with his brother, a stockbroker. Now Volkening&#x2019;s letters contained stock tips as well as news of contracts and foreign sales. This was the period when Lesha, Bellow&#x2019;s niece, began to hear him utter the phrase &#x201c;Vu bin ikh?&#x201d; (&#x201c;Where am I in this?&#x201d;) when deals and investments were discussed at family gatherings. He hired a Wall Street stockbroker and a prominent Chicago lawyer, Marshall Holleb, who was involved in real estate and property development. Because Bellow never fully engaged with business affairs, he was never very good at them, alternately too trusting or not trusting enough, impatient, shocked at setbacks. After almost 50 years of hard work and money worry, he found it difficult to accept the realities of prosperity. When Robert Hatch, an editor of <i>The New Republic</i>, met him in the summer of 1965, all Bellow could talk about was taxes. He had just written a check for 40,000 dollars to the Internal Revenue Service. When David Goldknopf, an old acquaintance, asked Bellow about acquiring an agent, he recommended &#x201c;a young woman named Candida Donadio&#x201d; from Volkening&#x2019;s office, later an important agent in her own right; Volkening himself, like Bellow, was &#x201c;overbusy, all too successful and risen into the nirvana of the harassed.&#x201d; When not harassed about money, Bellow glowed with success. Mitzi McClosky remembers him after <i>Herzog</i> as &#x201c;like a phoenix. The earlier Saul had disappeared. He was on top of the world.&#x201d;</p><h2>Options as a strategic investment: A comprehensive analysis of listed option strategies</h2><p>The standard resource for options traders and serious investors.

Enlivening and invigorating the dialogue on postsocialist politics, this imaginative study helps us understand the dynamic and deeply symbolic nature of politics&#x2015;and how it can breathe new life into old bones.</p><p>In <i>The Political Lives of Dead Bodies</i>, Katherine Verdery tries to jazz up political science by adding a dash of anthropology, examining the ways in which political upheavals are often accompanied by incidents involving the corpses of former leaders or other cultural heroes. "Dead bodies," she says, "have properties that make them particularly effective political symbols. They are thus excellent means for accumulating something essential to political transformation: symbolic capital."<p> Unfortunately, much of the inherent interest in matters such as the return of Transylvanian Catholic bishop Inochentie Micu's bones to his homeland more than two centuries after his death is crushed under the weight of Verdery's prose. By all rights, the role of historical personages in shaping nationalist myths <i>ought</i> to be a fascinating subject, deserving of analysis more dynamic than this: "Because corpses suggest the lived lives of complex human beings, they can be evaluated from many angles and assigned perhaps contradictory virtues, vices, and intentions." (Simon Schama's <i>Landscape and Memory</i>, for example, discusses several cases of the intersection of nationalism, historical memory, and natural landscape in a lively, engaging style perfectly accessible to a broad audience.) And although Verdery presents her work as a counterpoint to "the rationalistic and dry sense of politics that so many political analysts employ," readers--even those with patience for vehemently academic writing--may ask themselves who <i>hasn't</i> figured out by the end of the 1990s that culture shapes politics in chaotic and unpredictable ways. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Since 1989, scores of bodies across Eastern Europe have been exhumed and brought to rest in new gravesites.

For more information, please visit www.peterbenchley.com.1<br><br>The girl lay on the surface of the sea, looking into the water through a mask, and was afraid.<br><br>She was surprised to feel fear--a true, deep fear that bordered on panic--for not in years had anything in the sea frightened her.<br><br>But then, never in her life had she been actively, aggressively menaced by an animal. Creatures had snapped at her, and some had circled her, hungry and curious, but always a show of strength and confidence had sent them on their way in search of more appropriate prey.<br><br>But this animal did not seem to want to bite her, or eat her. It looked to her as if it wanted simply to hurt her, to stab her.<br><br>It had appeared with magical speed. One moment the girl was gazing into an empty blue haze; the next, she was staring at a sharp and pointed bill of bone that quivered three feet from her chest. The bill swooped back to a broadened base, and ended in two clam-size black eyes as cold as night.<br><br>Unlike the other billfish, this one had no fin on its back. It had instead a dorsal sail covering most of its backbone, which could lie flat against the back and be almost invisible, or stand in proud display.<br><br>Or, when the fish was agitated, as now, the sail pulsed up and down, up and down, as the head of a serpent hypnotizes a rodent.<br><br>The fish's tail was like a honed scythe. It twitched once, a shudder passed along the body, and the bill jerked quickly, startling the girl.<br><br>She did not know what to do, how to behave. Backing away was no answer: This was not territorial aggression, for this was not a territorial animal. It cruised the deep water of the open sea; it knew no home.<br><br>To move suddenly at it was no answer: The fish was supremely confident of its superiority over her--in speed and strength and agility--or it would not have approached her. She could not hope to shoo it away.<br><br>And to stay where she was seemed to be no answer: Apparently, she was somehow irritating the fish, for it shook its head, and its spear sliced the water and she felt its force against her chest.<br><br>Its long, slim pectoral fins dropped; its back hunched; its tail twitched. Its entire body was a cocked spring, ready, at the release of an inner trigger, to impale her on its bill.<br><br>Why?<br><br>It could not be pure malice, for her father had taught her that malice did not exist in animals. Animals could be hungry, angry, frightened, hurt, sick, defensive, protective, jealous, careless, or playful--and in any of those states could become vicious or violent--but not malevolent.<br><br>What, then? What did it want?<br><br>Again the head shook, and the spear slit the water.<br><br>She wondered if she could make it to her boat before the fish attacked. She fluttered her fingers and toes, hoping to propel herself backward, inch by inch, closer to her boat.<br><br>But how far away was the boat?<br><br>She turned her head a half-turn, flicked her eyes over her shoulder, saw the boat, and turned immediately back to face the fish.<br><br>It was gone.<br><br>She had felt nothing, heard nothing, and now all she could see was the endless blue.<br>2<br><br>There was no electricity on the island, and kerosene lamps burned with a thick, greasy smoke that made some people sick, so the old man and the girl chose to sit in a room illuminated only by the light that leaked around the edges of the covered windows. The old man kept the room dark intentionally, had put cloths over the windows, because the slashing rays of the late-afternoon sun colored the room with contrasts so sharp that they pained his eyes and confused him. He had cataracts in both eyes, and sudden bursts of bright light felt like little explosions in his brain.<br><br>The old man's name was Francisco, but everyone called him Viejo, Old Man, even the children who might have called him Grandfather or a pet name, because Viejo was an honor, a title as significant as Excellency or General. To attain old age was a true achievement.<br><br>The girl's name was Paloma-Dove--after the morning bird that cooed a prelude to the cock's crow. She was sixteen.<br><br>"I don't understand, Viejo," she said. "Nothing like that has ever happened to me before."<br><br>"You had never met a bad animal before. Now you have. It had to happen, eventually."<br><br>"Forgive me, but . . ." She hesitated. "Papa always told me there was no such thing as a bad animal."<br><br>"Your father Jobim was a . . . a curious man." Viejo sought gentle words to describe his son-in-law, rather than those that came quickly to mind. "Of course there are bad animals, just as there are bad people. I am only grateful that the sailfish you met today was not truly bad, or he would have run you through. That happens. Once, many years before you were born . . ."<br><br>To forestall the reminiscence, Paloma said, "I don't see why God would create a bad animal. It doesn't make sense."<br><br>Viejo pressed his lips together, which Paloma recognized as a sign of pique. He was a fine storyteller, and it was one of the few pleasures that life still permitted him.<br><br>"Who says you must understand everything?" Viejo said. "For a human being to try to fathom all of God's works is a waste of time."<br><br>Paloma tried to retreat. "I didn't mean . . ."<br><br>"What is, is. And one of the things that is, is that there are good things and bad things." He paused. "They tell me you have been interfering with the fishermen again."<br><br>"No! I only . . ."<br><br>"They say you shout and make a fool of yourself."<br><br>"They can think what they please. All I did was ask Jo and Indio and the others why they can't be more careful. They catch everything; they bring back fish they have no use for. They don't kill just for food. That I could understand. The way they fish, someday there will be nothing left."<br><br>"No. The sea is forever. And you must learn that man will hunt what he wishes for whatever reason he wishes. His judgments are his own. For example, it has been judged that some animals are good alive and dead, like the bonito and the tuna and the grouper. Alive, they feed other animals; dead, they feed people and still more animals, useful animals. Some animals are bad, like the sea snake and the stonefish and the scorpion. All they do is cause pain and death.<br><br>"And then there are animals both good and bad, like barracuda--which one day feeds a man handsomely and the next day poisons him--and like sharks. Sharks bring us food and money, true, but now and again they kill people."<br><br>"What about an angelfish?" Paloma asked. "What could be good or bad about an angelfish? Or a pufferfish? Indio caught a pufferfish the other day, and you'd think he had caught a marlin. Why? We don't sell them. We don't eat them."<br><br>"The fishermen make their living from the sea," said Viejo, "and so they must become one with the sea and all its creatures. Sometimes, the only way to come to know a creature is to catch and kill it."<br><br>Because Paloma did not want to distress or offend her grandfather, she did not argue further: His truths were unshakable. So, all she said was, "Well, I hope nothing ever wants to get to know me that well."<br>Outside Paloma looked to the western sky. The sun hovered over the horizon, as if about to be sucked beneath the shiny gray water.<br><br>She hurried to her rock, a narrow shelf of stone that jutted out over the western tip of the island. She came here at this time every day, and she loved both the place and the time of day, for this was where she felt at peace, close to nature, to life.<br><br>There were a few clouds overhead, and the setting sun painted them pink, but the horizon was cloudless, a blade beneath the red fireball that was slowly sliding downward and seeming to squash oblong.<br><br>Tonight might be a night for the green flash, she thought, and she steadied her chin in her hands and forced herself not to blink as she fastened her eyes on the vanishing sun. You almost never saw the green flash: The evening had to be clear and almost chilly; no waves of heat could be shimmering up from the water; the horizon had to be sharp and without even a wisp of cloud. And, of course, you had to be there and alert, and you couldn't blink, because the green flash lasted only that tiny bit of a second as the last infinitesimal rim of sun dipped below the horizon. Many times she had missed it by blinking, and in all her life she had seen it only twice--the first time the evening long ago when her father had led her by the hand and shown her this special place.<br><br>The bottom of the sun touched the horizon, and Paloma half expected to hear a hiss as the water quenched the fire, or see a cloud of steam explode from the sea. But smoothly and without a sound, it slipped faster and faster out of the sky.<br><br>Paloma held her breath and opened her eyes as wide as she could. The last of the sun dropped away and then, as Paloma was beginning to think there would be no green flash tonight, there it was--a shining pinprick of brilliant green, gone so fast that it became a memory at almost the same instant it registered as a sight.<br><br>Paloma watched the sky for a moment more, enjoying the changes that happened with such speed only at the beginning and end of the day. The yellow light was fading, following the sun to other parts of the world. The sky overhead was darkening quickly and soon was speckled with stars, and only the faintest splash of pink still touched the clouds.<br><br>Paloma felt suddenly calm and happy. Seeing the green flash was supposed to be an omen of good fortune, and though she didn't really believe in omens, surely it was better to have seen it than not to have seen it.<br><br>She rose to her knees and was about to leave the rock when a flicker of movement made her look back at the water. What she saw made her stop and stare and catch her breath again.<br><br>Rising clear of the water, outlined against the lapis sky, twisting in a spasm of pure pleasure, was an enormous marlin. Its saber blade sliced through the air, its sickle tail arched upward, and then, in graceful slow motion, the huge body slammed down upon the water.<br><br>It was a full second before Paloma heard the heavy, resonant boom, and by then all that remained as testimony to the acrobatics was a spreading ring of ripples on the sea.<br><br>That, Paloma thought, was definitely something special. Maybe nature is telling me I should believe in omens.<br><br>With a feeling of privilege, of being witness to nature reveling in itself, Paloma started for home. As she walked along the path, she looked down and saw her brother, Jo, and his two friends approaching the dock in their skiff.<br><br>Paloma could see from the top of the hill that they had had a good day. The bow of their boat was heaped high with fish, a kaleidoscope of glistening colors in the fading light. And Paloma could see, even from where she stood, that they had taken fish indiscriminately: Whatever they could catch they had killed. There were angelfish and rockfish, bonitos and jacks, pufferfish and stingrays, and even one of the rare and strange and furtive creatures called guitar sharks--harmless and, to fishermen, useless. Those fish that would not take a hook had been harpooned. Those that had eluded the harpoon had been netted.<br><br>As Paloma watched, Jo shut off the outboard motor and guided the wallowing skiff toward the dock, while his mates culled the piles of dead fish with their fingers, throwing overboard those that were not worth selling.<br><br>When Paloma had first seen them do this, she had erupted in fury, screaming at Jo, demanding to know why, if they intended to throw back the fish, they didn't do so as soon as they caught them, when the fish still had a chance to live.<br><br>If Jo had been startled at her anger, he had nevertheless been forthright in his response. "Early in the day, before we know the size of the catch, any fish is a good fish. By the end of the day, if the catch has been rich we can afford to keep only the good ones. So then we throw the bad ones back."<br><br>Paloma had tried to argue, but Jo had walked away, saying that was the way things had always been, and that was the way they would remain.<br><br>Now, she watched as the one called Indio picked up a small fish by its eye sockets and waved it at the other mate, Manolo. Though she was still a distance from them and the twilight was deepening, she could tell them apart by the color of their hair. Indio always wore a hat on the boat, so his hair had remained black. Manolo kept his head cool by pouring salt water on it, so his hair had been bleached to a light brown, just as Paloma's own long auburn hair had been bleached nearly blond by salt and sun. Indio said something now and threw the fish at Manolo, who picked up another fish by its tail and whacked Indio on the head with it.<br><br>Yowling and cursing, the fishermen flung fish at one another. Most missed their targets and landed in the water, to float there belly up.<br><br>To Paloma, striding down the hill, the fight was nauseating, the waste obscene. It offended something deep inside her to see dead animals treated as if they had never been live beings.<br><br>She bent over and picked up a rock and called out, "Hey!" The three in the skiff looked up. "If you have to throw things at each other, throw these." And she cocked her arm and threw the rock as hard as she could, hoping it would strike the skiff and knock a hole in it. But the rock flew wide and plopped in the water, and Jo responded by laughing and ticking his thumbnail off his front teeth and pointing at her--the coarsest, most insulting, and most contemptuous gesture he could make.<br><br>Paloma turned away.<br><br>Her father had explained the problem to her many times, during those early days when she had first complained about the young men who fished without care, taking everything and wasting much. "The sea, this sea, is too rich," he had said. "It has too much life."</p><h2>A Princess Primer: A Fairy Godmother&#39;s Guide to Being a Princess</h2><p>For ages the fairy godmother has helped make young girls&#39; dreams come true.

You&#x2019;re readin&#x2019; a book by us. Us. That&#x2019;s wilder than hill people on mushrooms during a thunderstorm.<br> <br>We ain&#x2019;t writers! I mean, we are, but as comedians, we just write jokes usually. You prolly knew that. Maybe not. Well, that&#x2019;s what we are: traveling joke salesmen. And we kinda figured we&#x2019;d always be just that (with hopefully a movie or TV show role peppered in). We were happy to live a life of no to moderate fame, eating fried food at three in the morning in a town no one had heard of and fallin&#x2019; asleep on floors and in terrible hotels with names like Tanya&#x2019;s Hideaway Bar and Inn. What&#x2019;s Tanya hidin&#x2019; from? Lord knows.<br> <br>Then Trae made a video and called himself the Liberal Redneck, and the world sort of changed. Life&#x2019;s weird.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. Like an actual book? Y&#x2019;all tryin&#x2019; to address Dixie with a damn book?! Like a readin&#x2019; book?!&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes. We are. It&#x2019;s a book about the love/hate relationship you have with your homeland. It&#x2019;s a book about the South and all its problems, but also all its beauty. We thought it was time to talk about where we&#x2019;re from with both empathy and tough love&#x2014;and have some damn laughs along the way. Feelin&#x2019; conflicted because you support gay rights but can&#x2019;t help that you still crave Chick-fil-A? Buddy, we get it. Mad as hell about what the local college&#x2019;s football coach and the hypocritical local senator said at their recent press conferences? Love buffets but hate yourself after you go? Well, boy, do we have something to make you feel better!<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it pills?&#x201d;<br> <br>No, damn it, it&#x2019;s this book! We&#x2019;re talkin&#x2019; about all that&#x2019;s right about life below the Mason-Dixon line and also all that&#x2019;s wrong&#x2014;like the damn pills. Anyone who has grown up in the South in the last thirty years understands, whether they&#x2019;ve ever thought about it or not, that there&#x2019;s a central dichotomy that permeates every aspect of Southern life. Even if you don&#x2019;t know what half them five-dollar words mean, if you&#x2019;re from here, you get what we&#x2019;re talkin&#x2019; about. A divide underlies the actions and words of every native Southerner. And no, it ain&#x2019;t &#x201c;Ford versus Chevy.&#x201d; The internal conflict that has defined what it means to be from the South is that of &#x201c;Pride versus Shame.&#x201d; For example, jean shorts. We invented &#x2019;em. They hit. They also somehow don&#x2019;t hit. Proud. Also ashamed.<br> <br>To those outside the South, the &#x201c;shame&#x201d; side of things is easy enough to understand. After all, there&#x2019;s plenty to be ashamed of down here (the Stars and Bars, Jim Crow, Florida Georgia Line, etc.). And we feel that way a lot. Duck Dynasty? Shame! Truck nuts? Shame! Institutional racism? Hell, double shame! We get it, is what we&#x2019;re saying. The shame is well founded. Spending all your extra money on a houseboat rental and a keg over Labor Day weekend hits. But for whatever reason, when your in-laws find out, you feel a little guilty&#x2014;like you ort not done that. That&#x2019;s what being from here is like, kinda.<br> <br>And many native Southerners live almost entirely on the shame side of the scale, leaving home the first chance they get, going out of their way to lose their accents and hide where they&#x2019;re from. It&#x2019;s a lot easier to resist ordering biscuits and gravy if you move to Connecticut and become gluten free, after all. These people who&#x2019;ve left behind their Southern home, sympathetic though their stance may be, are not helping. If everyone who&#x2019;s worth a damn just leaves as soon as possible, then what&#x2019;s left? How will things ever get better? Sure, the demolition derbies and meat shoots (that&#x2019;s where you shoot guns to win hams) will kick more ass without those pussies around, but race relations probably won&#x2019;t improve too much.<br> <br>Still, the people on the shame end of the scale are much easier to understand and deal with than those on the pride side of things. And these people are legion down here. After all, how could they not be, when everyone else just runs away? For those of you outside the South, when you think of &#x201c;rednecks,&#x201d; &#x201c;hillbillies,&#x201d; &#x201c;hicks,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Southern Baptists,&#x201d; these are the people you&#x2019;re picturing. They fly the Stars and Bars high from the back of their jacked-up trucks, the flagpole rising up between the bumper stickers on either side of the back glass with phrases like &#x201c;Drankin&#x2019; Beers and Shootin&#x2019; Deers&#x201d; and &#x201c;Honk If I&#x2019;m Payin&#x2019; for Your Health Care&#x201d; (because we all know the country&#x2019;s entitlement programs are propped up by the tree-trimming and pumping-gas-at-a-boat-dock industries). Well, we&#x2019;re ready to dive in on what exactly it is they&#x2019;re proud of. It can&#x2019;t be the 2.2 GPA they maintained at one of the worst public schools in a state ranked forty-ninth in education. Is it their ability to pound fourteen beers during the ball game and still drive home?<br> <br>No. There actually is a lot to be proud of down here. And that&#x2019;s the part that&#x2019;s so hard for outsiders to understand. They easily grasp the shame, but the pride leaves them dumbfounded. But, hell, fact is, we do some things better. College football? Check the scoreboard. Whiskey and bourbon? Shit ain&#x2019;t close. We celebrate as good or better than anyone else in the whole country. Hell, that&#x2019;s half the reason why we get so patriotic&#x2014;when lovin&#x2019; America and supportin&#x2019; the troops means gettin&#x2019; hammered on a lake and shootin&#x2019; fireworks at each other&#x2019;s faces, it&#x2019;s hard not to feel like you are in the best country on earth.

It was &#39;the conversation which God allows us to maintain with himself above, while we are here below...in which the soul of a saint often gets near to God, experiences great delight and, as it were, dwells with his heavenly Father for a short time before he comes to heaven.&#39; But Watts knew that most Christians need help in the use of this great privilege, so that our prayers should be both acceptable to God and &#39;a delightful and profitable exercise to our own souls and to those that join with us&#39;. In this helpful and practical guide, Watts deals in turn with the nature of prayer, prayer viewed as a gift which can be developed, prayer as dependent on the fruits of divine grace, and the assistance of the Spirit of God in prayer. In his final chapter he brings forward several arguments to persuade all Christians to develop and use &#39;this holy skill of conversation with God&#39;.</p><p>ISAAC WATTS (1674&#x2013;1748) was born in Southampton, England. His father, a schoolmaster, was jailed twice for his non-conformist faith. Isaac loved to read and attended the free school in Southampton. He started learning Latin at the age of four. He attended Rev. Mr. Thomas Rowe&#x2019;s Nonconformist Academy at Stoke Newington in London. He started writing poetry at fifteen. He became a preacher at 24, and remained in partnership with Samuel Price, an assistant and later joint pastor. He lived at Abney House with Sir Thomas and Lady Mary. He gave himself to preaching and writing his entire life. He was an industrious hymn writer who wrote over 600 hymns, among many other works.</p><h2>Forewords and Afterwords</h2><p>Critical essays illuminate the contemporary author&#39;s thoughts on literature, ideals, and creativity</p><p>The essays in this collection were written as reviews, mainly for The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, on books by or about Alexander Pope, Vincent van Gogh, Thomas Mann, Virginia Woolf, Oscar Wilde, and A.

Auden</b>&nbsp;(1907-1973) was one of the wittiest and most worldly of English poetry's great twentieth century masters. His work ranges from the political to the religious, from the urbane to the romantic. He is also, with his exhilarating lyrical power and understanding of love and longing in all their sacred and profane guises, an exemplary champion of human wisdom in its encounter with the mysteries of experience. More than any other poet, Auden used his poetry as an instrument to study the massive forces, dramas, and upheavals of the twentieth century, and his work displays an astonishing range of voice and breadth of concern.</p><h2>BATMAN: KNIGHTFALL (Bantam Spectra Book)</h2><p>With his health shattered after a confrontation with the arch-fiend Bane, Batman-Bruce Wayne must decide whether his apprentice, Jean Paul Valley, or Azrael, a violent young vigilante, is capable of taking over as Batman. 100,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>In 1994, DC Comics brought readers a landmark story featuring Batman. The Dark Knight has been Gotham City&#39;s protector for years, challenged by its many villains. But now there&#39;s a new villain on the scene, determined to conquer where others have failed. Known as Bane, he starts his campaign against Batman and Gotham by emptying Arkham Asylum, where so many of Batman&#39;s enemies are imprisoned and have spent their time plotting revenge. Almot single-handedly, Batman fights off these long-time opponents only to find himself so exhausted after it all that his strength fails him when Bane follows the onslaught to face Batman himself. Now Bruce Wayne is confined to a wheel-chair and must turn over his cloak and cowl to his apprentice, Azrael. But Azrael&#39;s philosophy of crime-fighting is much more violent and harsher than Batman&#39;s ever was.

What unfolds over the next few years is truly epic, constantly illuminating and surprising, sometimes comic, always entrancing, and ultimately all-too-human in its tragic grandeur.<br><br> Christophe, as educated as any Frenchman could be about the<i> &#x201c;</i>sauvages&#x201d; of the New World whose souls he has sworn to save, begins his true enlightenment shortly after he sets out when his native guides&#x2014;terrified by even a scent of the Iroquois&#x2014;abandon him to save themselves. But a Huron warrior and elder named Bird soon takes him prisoner, along with a young Iroquois girl, Snow Falls, whose family he has just killed. The Huron-Iroquois rivalry, now growing vicious, courses through this novel, and these three are its principal characters.<br><br> Christophe and Snow Falls are held captive in Bird&#x2019;s massive village. Champlain&#x2019;s Iron People have only lately begun trading with the Huron, who mistrust them as well as this Jesuit Crow who has now trespassed onto their land; and Snow Falls&#x2019;s people, of course, have become the Hurons&#x2019; greatest enemy. Bird knows that to get rid of them both would resolve the issue, but he sees Christophe, however puzzling, as a potential envoy to those in New France, and Snow Falls as a replacement for the two daughters he&#x2019;d lost to the Iroquois.&nbsp; <br><br> These relationships wax and wane as life comes at them relentlessly:&nbsp;a lacrosse match with an allied tribe, a dangerous mission to trade furs with the French for the deadly shining wood that could save the Huron nation, shocking victories in combat and devastating defeats, then&nbsp;a sickness the likes of which none of them has ever seen.&nbsp;The world of <i>The Orenda</i> blossoms to include such unforgettable characters as Bird&#x2019;s oldest friend, Fox; his lover, Gosling, who some believe possesses magical powers; two more Jesuit Crows who arrive to help form a mission; and boys from both tribes whose hearts veer wildly from one side to the other, for one reason or another. Watching over all of them are the spirits that guide their every move. <br><br> <i>The Orenda</i> traces a story of blood and hope, suspicion and trust, hatred and love, that comes to a head when Jesuit and Huron join together against the stupendous wrath of the Iroquois, when everything that any of them has ever known or believed in faces nothing less than annihilation.&nbsp;A saga nearly four hundred years old, it is also timeless and eternal.</p><p>Joseph Boyden&#x2019;s first two novels won virtually every prize that Canada has to offer. <i>Three Day Road </i>&nbsp;(2005):&nbsp; the Roger&#x2019;s Writers Trust Prize; the McNally Robinson Aboriginal Book of the Year; the Canadian Authors Association Book of the Year; the Libris Book of the Year; and the Amazon/Canada First Novel Award. <i>Through Black Spruce</i> (2008): the Scotiabank Giller Prize; the Libris Book of the Year; the Libris Author of the Year. <br><br>In 2012, Boyden was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for his contributions to Canadian art and culture.

I cannot ignore this fact. I write all of this down in the bound book I&#x2019;ve carried tucked in my robe, one of the very few comforts I possess. To bring Jesus into the lives of these people is one mission. To report my findings back to my Superior in Kebec, who will in turn send it to his back home in France, is the other. Ultimately, I write of my journeys and my struggles and my suffering to glorify You. I will die here for You if this is what is requested of me.<br> These sauvages, they are shameless in their lack of modesty. When the fire burns hot, the children run naked around the longhouse and the women strip down to their waist. The men often walk around in simple breechclouts, and a number of times I&#x2019;ve witnessed couples I am quite sure aren&#x2019;t married embracing and then slipping away. The light of the fires, the thick smoke, the primal grunts of passion, the laughing children, the chatter of this language that I struggle so hard to master, I think I might very well be in one of Dante&#x2019;s rings.<br> I record in my journal that each longhouse is the length and width of a small ship, and families related through the women reside within. As far as I can tell, eight or ten families, each with its own fire, fill these residences with the noises of humanity. I&#x2019;ve estimated anywhere from forty to sixty souls in each longhouse, and I believe there to be at least fifty longhouses in this community. What&#x2019;s more, I&#x2019;ve been told that this village is just one of many in what I&#x2019;ve termed Huronia, this land they call Wendake. While it&#x2019;s possible to walk the length of Huronia in just a few days, I&#x2019;ve learned that five separate and yet unified nations populate this fertile country, each with its own name. The people I reside with call themselves the Bear, and the other nations are named Rock and Cord and Swamp and Deer. Their sworn enemies, the Iroquois, also consist of five nations, but it seems that the Huron refer to them collectively as Haudenosaunee in their language.<br> The Huron are, as Champlain so duly noted a number of years ago, the key traders in a very large geography, controlling their business with the keen eye of a banker. They dominate the trade of tribes as disparate as the Montagnais to the north and the Neutral to the south. Their main currency is the vast quantity of corn that they grow each summer. I&#x2019;m fascinated to watch how their different systems work as time allows, but from what I can see, they trade their produce with the Algonquin and the Nipissing for those hunting people&#x2019;s furs, mainly beaver, which the Huron then paddle all the way to New France in the summer, where they trade those furs for staples such as iron axes and copper kettles and all form of glass beads, which to the Huron are as valuable as gold. They in turn bring back these treasures from New France and again trade them with their neighbours to the north and south. Yes, they are indeed the lynchpin to the economy of this new world.<br> Now that it&#x2019;s winter, each family sleeps up off the ground on raised platforms, mother on one end, father on the other, children squeezed in between. They are smart enough to peel the bark from the wood they burn but it&#x2019;s still sometimes so smoky that my eyes are often irritated. These longhouses are truly a wonder, like giant beehives woven together with saplings and covered in sheets of bark. Up in the rafters hang corn and beans and squash and tobacco and dried fish and all manner of food that I&#x2019;ve never seen before. The Huron winters are clearly the time of relaxation and enjoyment. All day long the mothers play with their children, and the dozen or so dogs that wander through the longhouse are treated as members of the family as well, eating from their hosts&#x2019; kettles and sleeping in their beds, and all this madness of life surrounds me while the men stand in groups, taking turns visiting one another&#x2019;s longhouses to talk and laugh and smoke pipes of tobacco.<br> The men are tall, some nearly my size. I&#x2019;ve always towered over my companions in France. Wasn&#x2019;t it the dear Bishop who nicknamed me the Brittany Giant? But these ones have a musculature that&#x2019;s impressive, taut stomachs and strong arms, their brown, hairless skin in the winter firelight like oil paintings that have come alive. Some have their women pluck and shave the hair from both sides of their heads with sharpened and intricately decorated clamshells, leaving a thick brush of it running down the centre that they grease until it stands on end. An ancient sailor on the miserable voyage over from the old world to this new one regaled all of us with his experiences in this land, going so far as to claim he was the one to first name these people Huron, wild boars, for how he thought the men&#x2019;s hair bristles like a pig&#x2019;s. Other warriors grow their hair long and shave off only one side of it, which leaves them looking frightening and half-mad. On the warpath, Bird and his soldiers paint their faces in red and yellow and black ochre. I am sure this was meant to stir the same fear in their enemies that it did in me.<br> The women are as striking as the men with their long shining black hair, their white smiles flashing against brown skin. They go to great lengths to decorate themselves, sometimes spending hours chattering as they braid feathers and tiny painted clay beads into one another&#x2019;s hair. Some of them have even tattooed their bodies with the images of animals, and these women seem held in high regard. Many of them love to flirt with me, regardless of their age. They smile coyly, and the younger ones think nothing of touching my hand or my arm, as if to prove to themselves that I&#x2019;m indeed real. Word has gotten out that my vows prevent me from being with women, but obviously their simplicity prevents them from understanding the complexity of Catholicism. As I preached the other day, after much confusion in our mutual understanding, a man dared to ask me if I preferred boys, causing all the others to laugh hysterically. This childlike comprehension of the world will be both my greatest test and a wonderful tool. I&#x2019;ll treat them as I once treated young children back in France when I was given the rather odious mission of teaching them the catechism.<br> These first ten days, I feel like a prisoner in this glowing longhouse filled with smoke. Bird is clearly an important man in this community. I&#x2019;ve watched people bring him gifts and come to visit now that he&#x2019;s back. And I understand the crowds come as much to see me as they do Bird. I take this opportunity to try to bring a little of God&#x2019;s light into this dark corner of the world. For months last year back in Kebec, I worked on learning the Huron language, a converted sauvage with the Christian name of Luke teaching me its guttural intricacies.<br> He explained that I had to begin to grasp the natural world around me if I were ever to conquer the language. The Huron, Luke said, don&#x2019;t live above the natural world but as a part of it. The key to their language was to make the connection between man and nature. I scoffed at this. A language doesn&#x2019;t exist that can&#x2019;t be learned by rote. And You, Lord, have given us the natural world for our use and our governance. Man was not meant to grovel in the dirt with animals but to rise above them. I make note in my relations to be sent back in due course to you, my dear Superior, that this is a lesson paramount for the conversion of the sauvages. I had long ago proved myself masterful with languages. Thanks be to God, I&#x2019;ve been given the gift of Latin and Greek, a little English, some Dutch. In fact, dear Superior, did you not choose me for this mission to New France because of my ability to learn new tongues?<br> Just one more reflection for now, something I find both fascinating and appalling. In matters of the spirit, these sauvages believe that we all have within us a life force that is similar, if you will, to our own Catholic belief in the soul. They call this life force the orenda. That is the fascinating part. What appals me is that these poor misguided beings believe not just humans have an orenda but also animals, trees, bodies of water, even rocks strewn on the ground. In fact, every last thing in their world contains its own spirit. When I pushed Bird about this, he explained it to me in a rather odd way. He told me of a recent hunting trip in which he pursued a deer for a long time. Eventually he caught up to and killed it. &#x201c;My orenda overpowered its orenda,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The deer&#x2019;s orenda allowed me to take it.&#x201d; He then looked at me as if his words might explain with final clarity this strange belief of theirs. I have to admit, dear Superior, that I&#x2019;m still left confused.<br> Today, a dozen of them sit on the ground in front of me, staring and whispering amongst themselves, watching my every move and study- ing me with such intensity that I begin to sweat. Those closest to me hold their noses or fan their faces as if I&#x2019;m the one who reeks, despite their overpowering smells of smoke and hide and what I can only describe as lustful intention. A couple of young women sitting at my feet try to peer up my cassock and then laugh as they mimic me blessing myself. An old man near the wall sits with a rigid back and his arms crossed, his thin lips scowling.<br> Like a child struggling for words, I slowly begin with the holy lamb. But there is no such thing as a lamb in the world of these people, and so Jesus becomes a fawn, a fawn whose blood is spilled so that we might live eternally. One heckler, an old woman, says loudly that the thought of fawn&#x2019;s blood makes her hungry in this winter when fresh meat is scarce, and why do I torture her so? The others laugh at this. I&#x2019;ve learned quickly that they laugh often, even at the most inappropriate times.<br> &#x201c;If you take the fawn that is Jesus into your life,&#x201d; I say slowly and then stop, straining for the words. &#x201c;Your hunger. Gone.&#x201d;<br> They scoff at this. &#x201c;Not go hungry ever again?&#x201d; one young man asks. &#x201c;Does this mean we are dead?&#x201d; Again there is more laughter and more discussion in their tongue, all of it too quick for me to understand.<br> When the crowd breaks down like this, usually after only a few minutes of my speaking, I know I&#x2019;ve lost them. And that&#x2019;s when I take my chalice and white cloth from my bag, and I use a bit of their sagamit�, the horrid corn mush they call ottet that&#x2019;s the staple of their diet in the winter and on travels. With this mush that I&#x2019;ve flattened and dried and rounded into a small Host, I perform the most sacred of sacraments, lifting the chalice of melted snow water to Heaven so that it might become Your blood, raising the corn wafer to the sky so it transforms into Your flesh. This always silences them. They watch every little move with the eyes of hawks, all humour gone from their faces. Apparently, they&#x2019;re more susceptible to my actions than to my words. I&#x2019;ve made careful note of this, and wait patiently for the day when one of them will dare ask that he or she might also take a sip from the chalice, a nibble from my outstretched hand.<br> And yet there&#x2019;s one who watches everything, who misses nothing, who doesn&#x2019;t rudely interrupt when I preach. The young Iroquois girl hides beneath her sleeping robe, the girl I carried in my arms through that nightmarish day. In all the time we&#x2019;ve been here, I can&#x2019;t remember seeing her move from her perch above me in the bed beside Bird&#x2019;s. I desperately hope that no ill intention exists in Bird&#x2019;s loins. I find it very strange indeed that he&#x2019;s the only one in the longhouse without a wife or family. Has the sauvage taken this girl to be a child bride? I will keep a close eye on this.<br> Early this morning I wake up in the dark, the wind blowing hard and Bird stoking the fire before sneaking out of the longhouse. Sleep beckons me back to its warmth and comfort, and it&#x2019;s exactly this I know I must fight. I deserve neither of these as long as those around me remain heathen. Forcing myself up from my blanket, I kneel on the hard ground in the corner away from the fire in just my nightshirt, shivering through my morning prayers and contemplation. The girl troubles me. She troubles me deeply. The image of her stripping naked in the snow and offering herself to me is burned into my memory no matter how hard I try to erase it. It was her smile as she lay exposed there, asking me something I couldn&#x2019;t comprehend. And then the wickedness of what she wished me to do dawned on me and forced my hand harshly across her mouth. I&#x2019;ve already made careful note of this in my relations to dear Superior, which I can only hope will eventually reach him. The one conclusion I can draw from the depravity and brutality I&#x2019;ve witnessed so far is that these beings, while certainly human, exist on a plane far lower than even Europe&#x2019;s lowest caste.<br> I must remember, though, that all of us are God&#x2019;s creatures. It is my mission to begin to help these poor souls rise up. The only way that their eternal souls might be saved is to accept Jesus, and to do this they must accept the Eucharist.<br> As if Christ Himself speaks directly to me on this frigid morning deep in this troubled land, I can see a vision materialize through the fog of my breath. The girl will become my first convert. I know this as surely as anything I&#x2019;ve ever known. I remember her hand clutch- ing my crucifix as we walked the last miles and were accosted by the Huron sentries. The poor thing is in desperate need of redemption. Her tempting me is evidence. And I have been brought here to offer it to her.<br> When I am finished my morning vespers, I don my heavy black robe, noting that it&#x2019;s saturated with my scent, the heavy stink of hard labour, the sour odour of sheer fear, and suddenly I feel self-conscious. I push this worry away. I must rise above the physical stains of humanity. My mission is more than the mundane facts of everyday life. I am more than that.<br> The sounds of sleep still echo through the longhouse as I climb the ladder to the young girl&#x2019;s bed. It strikes me I don&#x2019;t even know her name. No need. Soon enough, I will give her a Christian one. This will be a first for this territory, and word of it will travel far.<br> The girl lies on her back, tucked into a plush beaver robe. Her mouth is slightly open and I can&#x2019;t help but smile to notice a thin string of spit runs from the side of it. She appears deep in sleep, and for this I&#x2019;m thankful. She&#x2019;s been through so much. We all have. Though Bird tied me to a tree out of sight of her family&#x2019;s massacre, the sounds of struggle and screaming and slaughter still haunt me. The girl has gone mute for good reason. At her age she saw what no one should ever have to witness. The brutality these people are so willing to show their enemies astounds me.<br> I stare at the girl for a long time in the dim light, trying to understand her. I suddenly realize that I am trying to see her humanity. She&#x2019;s not very beautiful, at least in comparison to the other children around her. She&#x2019;d be better looking if not for the scars of some childhood disease that ravaged her face. Epidemics have begun to sweep through these people the last few years. I can only take this as a sign from God, a divine message. Any fool can see that when great change comes, the weak and the wicked will suffer. But the converted will live on.<br> I bless myself and whisper prayers of devotion and of gratitude and of guidance. I pray most fer...</p><h2>There Is A Season: A Memoir</h2><p>Believed by many to be one of the finest poets of his generation, Patrick Lane is also a passionate gardener. He lives on Vancouver Island, a place of uncommon beauty, where the climate is mild, the air is soft, and the growing season lasts nearly all year long.<br><br>Lane has gardened for as long as he can remember, and sees his garden&#x2019;s life as intertwined with his own. And when he gave up drinking, after years of addiction, he found solace and healing in tending to his yard. In this exquisitely written memoir, he relates stories of his hard early life in the context of the landscape he&#x2019;s created. As he observes the seasonal changes, a plant or a bird or the way a tree bends in the wind brings to mind an episode from his storied past.<br><br>Lane writes evocative descriptions of the animals, birds, insects, and plants that are his garden, and of the relationship he has to them all. Accompany Lane as he wanders his garden, where botanical &#x201c;madeleines&#x201d; release in him a flood of memory.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Patrick Lane</b> is the author of 21 books of poetry, and has received many awards for his writing, including the Governor General&#x2019;s Award for Poetry (1979), the Canadian Authors Association Award for Poetry (1988), and two National Magazine Awards. Lane lives near Victoria, British Columbia, with poet Lorna Crozier.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>&#x201c;If what we know is what resembles us, what we know is a garden.&#x201d;<br><br></i>I stood alone among yellow glacier lilies and the windflowers of spring, the western anemone, their petals frail disks of trembling clotted cream. I was a boy and the mountain ridge I&#x2019;d climbed was only a half-hour hike from the back door of my home. In the east the blue peaks of the Monashee Range rose up against the Selkirks and beyond them the far Rockies and the plains. I had wandered that morning among sheltered coulees and rocky hills and, finally resting, stared out at the paling distance. <br><br>The high hills and mountains were my solitary land and I hiked the trails year-round. The days were all one to me back then, and the scuffed pad of a cougar&#x2019;s track in the wet clay of Six-Mile Creek in summer was no less wondrous than the spread toes of a coyote&#x2019;s paw print in a fringe of January snow on the BX Ranch where he had braced to leap upon a vole or scurrying mouse who had come lucklessly into the thin winter sun. <br><br>There were black bears and the occasional cougar or bobcat in those hills, but when I saw one I felt awe, not fear. Even then I knew what a blessing an animal was. Any creature&#x2019;s appearance was a gift the wilderness gave me. The animals of the backcountry were unused to humans in those days and they stepped around me as much as I did them. Sometimes a cougar would take a lamb or two in the spring from some flock and then the game warden would walk his dogs into the hills to track the big cat down. He hated killing cougars. <br><br>Often he would take me along on those trips; why, I don&#x2019;t know. Perhaps he felt sorry for me or perhaps my father asked him to in the hope it would make me a man. Gazing at a cougar lolling on a high limb of a ponderosa pine above Lumby while the cougar dogs slung their howls from the foot of the tree at the flick of its black-tipped tail was to look at a god. I watched from the back of an old white horse as Mr. Frisbee pulled his Winchester from beside his saddle and brought the cougar down with a single shot. The cougar falling from the sky was my first huge death. <br><br>I remember touching the rough blond hair of a dead cat&#x2019;s nape, the curve of its long yellow incisors, and the dead ball of its eye as it stared sightless through me to the fading sun. These deaths drew me toward a compassion I didn&#x2019;t fully understand. All I knew was that such sentiments were not spoken of among men or boys. Feeling deeply about something was never shown. <br><br>But it is not the cougars or bobcats, the bears or rattlesnakes of that early wilderness I think of now. It is another early memory that stays in my mind. I was up in the Bluebush hills west of Kalamalka and Okanagan Lake. I had hiked back into the hills with a peanut butter and jam sandwich, two apples, and a water bottle in the army satchel my father had brought back from the Second World War. I took it with me whenever I hiked out for a day. I stood on a crest in a frothing meadow of glacier lilies and anemones, and their fragile beauty remains with me. It lives in the blood and muscle of me and I can still call it up and bring it into spirit. <br><br>Grasses, their stalks flattened and flung by the winter snow, lay like fallen hair upon the earth, and their new green spears caught the wind with frail hands. A mountain meadow and a boy in the long-ago of the last century. Did I know then it was a garden I looked out upon? Had I been asked I would not have understood the question. Garden? Wilderness? I gave the meadow no thought. Had someone asked me if what I saw was beautiful I would not have known what he meant. A boy is a boy and he is the place he inhabits. He is what surrounds him and the boy I was remains with me in the image of yellow lilies and creamy anemones among the grasses and scattered stones. <br><br>What was I, ten years old? A child, a stripling boy, but those mountains and deserts live in me still and when I go back into that country my heart surges with sudden blood. The past hurls itself at me at times. My bones remember the water and the stones. I grew my body from that mountain earth, and my cells remember the cactus and pines, the lilies and grasses. I am as much blessed as burdened by this. <br><br>It is such beauty that made me into a gardener. Perhaps by planting flowers and shrubs and trees I am trying to return to that earlier paradise. Yet finally, not. My garden today is another kind of paradise, and I am not the boy wandering in what another might call loneliness but to me was solitude. <br><br>What I do remember is squatting and building a small cairn of stones in the middle of the meadow. There was no death to cover over, no occasion to ritualize other than the day itself and the curious busyness of a boy. But, like all animals, I wanted to leave some mark that I had been there so others who followed would know of my passing. Perhaps the mound of stones is still there or perhaps it&#x2019;s been kicked over by a deer or coyote or some other boy who pillaged the cairn to make his own curious mark. Perhaps the snow, ice, and wind have spilled it. Whether or not the cairn is gone, the stones remain like ghosts in my hands and that is enough. <br><br>Today, fifty-two years later, I am not in a mountain meadow in southern British Columbia. I am in my garden on Vancouver Island and it is early January in the first year of the new century. The sky is grey and the small drops of rainwater gathered on moss and fallen leaves glimmer like opals in the winter sun. In the declivities of grass, apples lie where they fell three months ago. Under the scrabbled branches of the apple tree a red-shafted flicker carves white flesh from a fallen fruit. He feeds on the slim bounty of the season and doesn&#x2019;t fully trust the grass and moss I still call a lawn though each year I starve it, encouraging the mosses to flourish. The flicker&#x2019;s claws are better suited to the bark of trees where he spends the day climbing patiently up the trunks in search of insects who have buried themselves in slits to sleep out the gloomy winter months.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Gettysburg</h2><p>By Stephen W. Sears, previously author of Chancellorsville and many other acclaimed Civil War histories. 623 pages including an index. ISBN 0-395-56478-4. From an Amazon reader review: &#34;There are two Civil War writers who concentrate on the Eastern Theater of the war, and are prominent enough to garner attention outside their field. One is Stephen W. Sears, the other is Noah Andre Trudeau. Sears has concentrated on the first half of the war, mostly writing about the campaigns of George McClellan, while Trudeau has worked in the last half of the war, making a name for himself as the best-known chronicler of Grant&#39;s Overland Campaign in 1864. Last year, Trudeau presented us with Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage, a long and very good account of the battle and its consequences. It seems these two historians have met in the middle of the war, because we are now presented with Stephen W. Sears&#39; simply titled Gettysburg. Sears is a different writer than Trudeau, and he presents the battle in a different fashion, the book in a different manner. While Trudeau&#39;s book is long and dense (no illustrations, ca. 600 pages of text), Sears&#39; book is considerably shorter, and more accessible. It has illustrations, either photographs of the participants or artwork done by participants or witnesses. Since they take up space on the page, and I would judge the font to be a point or two larger, my guess is this book is a good 25% shorter than Trudeau&#39;s. That makes it more accessible (as does the inclusion of illustrations, one shortcoming of Trudeau&#39;s book) and easier to read.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Millennium Cookbook: Extraordinary Vegetarian Cuisine</h2><p><p><b>Elegant vegetarian cooking from the Bay Area's famed Millennium restaurant.</b></p><p>San Francisco's Millennium restaurant is renowned for its elegant, intriguing, and delicious vegetarian fare.

If Kierkegaard, then, writes Louis Mackey, is to be understood, he must be studied with the tools of literary criticism: "whatever philosophy there is in Kierkegaard is sacramentally transmitted 'in, with, and under poetry.'"</p><p>"The study of Kierkegaard," states Louis Mackey, "can throw new light on the relationship between philosophy and poetry." In these impressive analyses of Kierkegaard's most important works, a modern philosopher has written a book that is in itself a work of literary grace and distinction.</p></p><p>Louis Mackey was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.<p>"I naturally approve highly of the effort to base a study of Kierkegaard in literary criticism, which is by far the most relevant approach to him, and one that helps correct the distortions of work on him which ignores this aspect."&#x2014;Northrop Frye</p><br><br><p>"A sensitive, perceptive study by a philosopher who can write as well as think with verve. It's a joy to read it."&#x2014;Paul Weiss</p><br><br><p>"It is a book written by a dialectician of Kierkegaard's stature and with subtle wit, mastery of prose, and the ability to be succinct where Kierkegaard was discursive: no summary can do justice to the richness of insight in this book, and it is a source of quotations for anyone with a genuine interest in literature or philosophy, It is undoubtedly the most rewarding book that has come my way in many years."&#x2014;Martin J.

Shipwrecked off the western coast of North Africa in August of 1815, James Riley and his crew had no idea of the trials awaiting them as they gathered their beached belongings. They would be captured by a band of nomadic Arabs, herded across the Sahara Desert, beaten, forced to witness astounding brutalities, sold into slavery, and starved. Riley watched most of his crew die one by one, killed off by cruelty or caprice, as his own weight dropped from 240 pounds to a mere 90 at his rescue. First published in 1817, this dramatic saga soon became a national bestseller with over a million copies sold. Even today, it is rare to find a narrative that illuminates the degradations of slave existence with such brutal honesty.</p><p>In this classic tale of adventure, a young American sea captain named James Riley, shipwrecked off the western coast of North Africa in 1915, was captured by a band of nomadic Arabs, and sold into slavery. Thus begins an epic adventure of survival and a quest for freedom that takes him across the Sahara desert.&nbsp;This dramatic account of Captain Riley's trials and sufferings sold more than 1,000,000 copies in his day, and was even read by a young and impressionable Abraham Lincoln. The degradations of a slave existence and the courage to survive under the most harrowing conditions have rarely been recorded with such painful honesty.&nbsp;Sufferings in Africa is a classic travel-adventure narrative, and a fascinating testament of white Americans enslaved abroad - during a time when slavery flourished through the United States.survived the wreck of the<br><br>, chronicling his ordeal in the book&nbsp;Sufferings in Africa, then later pioneering the town of Willshire, Ohio.<br><br>is the author of numerous books, including the national bestseller<br><br>.</p><h2>Justice Of The Mountain Man</h2><p>After getting into a fight with a thief called the Durango Kid, Smoke Jensen finds himself framed for the murder of one of Durango&#39;s gang and arrested by legendary U.S. Marshall Bill Tilghman and sets out to escape, find the Durango Kid, and clear his name.

Vos handles this under three main divisions: the Mosaic epoch of revelation, the prophetic epoch of revelation, and the New Testament. Such an historical approach is not meant to supplant the work of the systematic theologian; nevertheless, the Christian gospel is inextricably bound up with history, and the biblical theologian thus seeks to highlight the uniqueness of each biblical document in that succession. The rich variety of Scripture is discovered anew as the progressive development of biblical themes is explicated. To read these pages-the fruit of Vos&#39;s 39 years of teaching biblical theology at Princeton-is to appreciate the late John Murray&#39;s suggestion that Geerhardus Vos was the most incisive exegete in the English-speaking world of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><h2>Anime Mania: How to Draw Characters for Japanese Animation (Manga Mania)</h2><p>There&#x2019;s no doubt about it: Japanese animation is hot. Television shows, films, and videos featuring the anime style of animation are wildly popular. Japanese animation is like a comic book come to life, retaining all its power but in moving form. It has a very different style from traditional western animation, incorporating heavy shading, dramatic camera angles, and beautifully rendered special effects&#x2014;especially the fantastic anime depictions of ocean waves, storms, smoke, and explosions. Easier to draw than its western counterpart, anime is more limited and simpler in its execution. In Japanese anime the characters move, but their movements are generally staccato, sharp, and dramatic&#x2014;not free-flowing with lots of overlapping action, anticipation, and follow-through.<br><br>In <i>Anime Mania</i>, famous cartoonist, teacher, and best-selling author Christopher Hart demonstrates how any comic book artist can become expert in this wonderful style of animation. Step by step, he details how to draw the coolest anime characters from the widest selection of popular styles: high-tech cyberpunks who live in the world of the future; teen characters&#x2014;with troubled relationships at school, home, and on the street; and mighty monsters, fantasy warriors, and giant robots. Aspiring animators will also find chapters on anime&#x2019;s spectacular special effects, the role of storyboarding in anime, sketching and the art of character design, and a mini-crash course in perspective. The book concludes with interviews with Scott Frazier, an American anime director working in Japan, and Mahiro Meada, a renowned Japanese animation director.<br><br>Brimming with hundreds of spectacular examples, illustrations, and step-by-step exercises, <i>Anime Mania</i> details how anyone can become a real anime artist without having to reinvent the art of drawing.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART is the world&#39;s bestselling author of drawing and cartooning books. His books have sold more than 7.4 million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Renowned for up-to-the-minute content and easy-to-follow steps, all of Hart&#39;s books have become staples for a new generation of aspiring artists and professionals, and they have been selected by the American Library Association for special notice.A successful contributor to MAD magazine, the "Blondie" cartoon strip, and various film and TV productions, Hart previously brought us Manga Mania: How To Draw Japanese Comics. In this follow-up, he demonstrates anime, the unique Japanese animation style of heavy shading, dramatic camera angles, and beautifully rendered special effects, most popularly known to U.S. audiences through series like Digimon and Sailor Moon. Based more on character than action, these anime include high-tech cyberpunks and teen characters with troubled relationships, as well as monsters, fantasy warriors, and giant robots. Hart covers storyboarding, sketching, perspective, the basics of animating, and the functioning of an animation studio. Rounding out the book are interviews with two anime directors.

Sister Joan has been assigned by Prioress Dorothy to clear out the attic storerooms of the convent building, home for centuries to the wealthy Tarquin family and bought for a song from the estate of Sir Robert Tarquin--a punishment, according to gossip, for his ne'er-do-well son Grant, who was left little but a small house in the village. Grant, an accident victim abroad, lies next to his father in the abbey tombs. Or does he? Following up on a circular left at the convent, offering to buy scrap and old silver, Sister Joan meets answering service worker Jane Sinclair, who has never seen the man whose name is on the circular but who's much interested in a Tarquin family album borrowed from her landlady. Days later, Jane is found strangled. A second strangling victim is young Jeb, a squatter in Grant's empty house. In Sister Joan's mind, the identity of the killer is never in doubt-- confirmed by her discovery of a third body in the convent attics, the results of a long overdue exhumation order, and a final confrontation with the unsurprising killer. The usual overload of convent routine and ritual; lots of sinister lurking figures, but little suspense in a plot that edges into sheer silliness with a common-sensedefying sacrificial gesture to wind it up. The weakest link to date in this modestly diverting chain. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>She has a sharp sense of humor, a keen mind, a stubborn and inquisitive nature. She is also devout and obedient?sometimes. Sister Joan of the Order of the Daughters of Compassion makes her eighth appearance (after A Vow of Fidelity) in a cautious story that, despite the influence of her continually engaging personality, falters under massive contrivance and tortured logic. The Order, located in Cornwall, has inherited the manor house of the venerable Tarquin family, extinct now with the burial of disreputable Grant Tarquin some 18 months earlier. While Sister Joan cleans out the manor's storage areas in hopes of finding a few salable antiques, an advertising circular from "G.T. Monen, scrap merchant and silversmith" is slipped beneath the door. She sets off on his trail, unwittingly triggering a disastrous series of events that leads her to some macabre discoveries: the body of Monen's secretary; the corpse of a teenaged thug; and the grisly 25-year-old remains of a young woman locked in the convent's storeroom trunk. What is equally disturbing is that Sister Joan is being stalked?and she swears it is by Grant Tarquin himself. Joan's wry wit and shrewd observations add zest to the mystery, but wooden dialogue and an egregious deus ex machina at the end undo the novel. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shadows in Bronze</h2><p>"I haven't read historical fiction this good since I, CLAUDIUS by Robert Graves and PERSIAN BOY by Mary Renault--and this is a lot funnier."<br>DETROIT FREE PRESS<br>He's Rome's favorite son, and of late, Emperor Vespasian's favorite palace spy, charged with finding the culprits who are plotting his imperial demise.

The band has sold more than eighty million records, has broken every concert attendance record set by Elvis Presley and the Beatles, stands behind the Beatles alone in number of gold records from any group in history, and has spawned more than 2,500 licenses. <br><br>There would have been no KISS without Gene Simmons, the outrageous star whose superlong tongue, legendary sexual exploits, and demonic makeup have made him a rock icon. <b>KISS and Make-Up</b> is the wild, shocking, unbelievable story, from the man himself, about how an immigrant boy from Israel studied to be a rabbi, was saved by rock and roll, and became one of the most notorious rock stars the world has ever seen.<br>Before Gene Simmons there was Chaim Witz, a boy from Haifa, Israel, who had no inkling of the life that lay ahead of him. In vivid detail Gene recounts his childhood growing up in Haifa under the watchful eye of his beloved, strong-willed mother, a concentration camp survivor; his adolescent years attending a Jewish theological center for rabbinical studies in Brooklyn; his love of all things American, including comic books, superheroes, and cowboys; and his early fascination with girls and sex, which prompted him to start a rock band in school after he saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show.<br><br><b>KISS and Make-Up</b> is not just the classic story of achieving the American dream through the eyes of an immigrant boy making good, but a juicy, rollicking rock and roll read that takes you along for the ride of your life with KISS, from the 1970s, when they were the biggest band in the world, through the &#x2019;80s, when they took off their world-famous war paint, and into the &#x2019;90s, when they came back bigger and badder than ever to become the number one touring band in the world. <br><br>In his own irreverent, unapologetic voice, Gene talks about the girls (4,600 of them and counting); his tight bond with KISS cofounder Paul Stanley; the struggles he and Paul had with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss and their departures from the group; the new band members and Eric Carr&#x2019;s untimely death; the enormous love and affection he has for the people who put him there in the first place&#x2014;the KISS Army and the ever-loyal KISS fans around the world; his love life, including stories about his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross and with Shannon Tweed, Playmate of the Year, mother of his son and daughter, and his companion of eighteen years; and much more.<br><br>Full of dozens of photographs, many never-before-seen pictures from Gene&#x2019;s private collection, <b>KISS and Make-Up</b> is a surprising, intimate look at the man behind the mask. For the first time Gene reveals all the facets of his complex personality&#x2014;son, rock star, actor, record producer, businessman, ladies&#x2019; man, devoted father, and now author.</p><p>Gene Simmons has acted in movies and television, has written and produced albums for other recording artists, has managed the recording career of, among others, Liza Minnelli, and was founder and president of his own record label, Simmons Records/RCA. He has recently launched his movie and television producing career with Detroit Rock City for New Line Cinema. He is also the creator and publisher of his own magazine, through Sterling/Macfadden, called <i>Gene Simmons&#x2019; Tongue</i>. Gene Simmons lives in Beverly Hills, California.The "Phantom of the Park," aka Simmons, needs nary a ghostwriter to pen his bio, for he ably delivers this season's most fascinating backstage pass. Articulately detailing his life from his birth in Israel through the 30-year life span of Kiss, he charts how glam-metal's greatest pioneers provided the most outrageous spectacles of arena rock in the 1970s. Those same pyrotechnics, pneumatic drum risers, jacked-up personas and frightening face paints have sold 80 million records worldwide. Simmons, the "guy who sticks his tongue out and spits fire," boasts other onstage innovations, including "throwing up blood" and creating the ubiquitous headbanger's hand sign for the devil. All in all, the rock 'n' roll extravaganzas of the Kiss empire hardly run short of the obvious wild parties, famous faces, hotel fiascoes, banging up cars and getting busy with groupies. Though no Wilt Chamberlain, Simmons describes at length how he has slept with 4,600 women. But when the smoke clears, the book is as well written as it is interesting: the story of a Jewish kid from Brooklyn, the endearingly sincere struggles Simmons faces over the years, his eventual marriage and fatherhood as well as juicy material like his extended romances with Cher and Diana Ross. While moldering rock stars who have tales to tell may be a dime a dozen, Simmons's enjoyable and intriguing autobiography deserves attention. 50 b&amp;w photos.

The title piece, a defense of Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, generated lively controversy when it first appeared in the New Republic; a spirited exchange from that journal is included here. Elsewhere, Fussell hails George Orwell's essays as a refreshing counterweight to today's "theory-ridden" criticism. Mulling the difference between tourists and travelers, he offers disarming observations on travel writers Paul Theroux and John Krich. One piece explores how patriotic fervor thrust Carl Sandburg's propaganda tracts into the literary limelight. Fussell has quirky, interesting things to say about gun control, war poetry, chivalry and modernism as an offshoot of the "melodrama of the French Revolution." <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Most of these 14 essayson topics ranging from Hiroshima to the Indy 500originally appeared in the New Republic , Sewanee Review , and other periodicals. One essay praises George Orwell for virtues that Fussell himself has cultivated: an accessible style, a lively interest in the social uses of language, and "a power of facing unpleasant facts." Fussell is even keener on exposing the euphemisms and illusions of others. His most valuable pieces deal with the horrors of modern warfare and its literaturesomewhat extending and generalizing his powerful The Great War and Modern Memory (1975).

In addition to his numerous comic book credits, Wolfman has also written several novels and worked in series television and animation, including the <i>Superman</i> cartoon of the late 1980s and currently the hit <i>Teen Titans</i> show on Cartoon Network.<br><br><b>George P�rez</b> started drawing at the age of five and hasn't stopped since. Born on June 9, 1954, P�rez began his professional comics career as an assistant to Rich Buckler in 1973. After establishing himself as a penciller at Marvel Comics, P�rez came to DC in 1980, bringing his highly detailed art style to such titles as <i>Justice League of America</i> and <i>Firestorm</i>. After co-creating <i>The New Teen Titans</i> in 1980, P�rez and writer Marv Wolfman reunited for the landmark miniseries <i>Crisis On Infinite Earths</i> in 1985. In the aftermath of that universe-smashing event, P�rez revitalized <i>Wonder Woman</i> as the series' writer and artist, reestablishing her as one of DC's preeminent characters and bringing in some of the best sales the title has ever experienced. He has since gone on to illustrate celebrated runs on Marvel's&nbsp;<i>The Avengers, CrossGen's Solus</i>, and DC's <i>The Brave and the Bold</i>.</p><h2>The Art of Arousal</h2><p>Describes and depicts erotic paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings from around the world, exploring the elements of and approaches to sexuality in each one</p><p>Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer is known by most children as &#34;Dr. Ruth Wordheimer&#34; on PBS KIDS&#39; &#34;Between the Lions&#34;. Dr. Westheimer is a therapist and an expert on family issues. She&#39;s also a devoted grandparent.Well-known sex therapist Westheimer here presents a provocative, richly eclectic, inspirational collection of erotic art. Chapters proceed methodically from flirtation and seduction to foreplay, the embrace, solitary and group pleasures and conclude with blissful exhaustion--a loose framework for organizing more than 100 color reproductions of works by Georgia O'Keeffe, Titian, Watteau, Durer, Manet, Courbet, Egon Schiele, David Hockney and others. The scope is multicultural, embracing Persian miniatures, a Cambodian sandstone female torso, a Dogon primordial couple from west Africa and Hopi carver Fred Koruh's interlocking male and female kachina dolls. Westheimer's exhortatory interjections on foreplay, lovemaking positions and so forth seem intrusive amidst the shrewd art-historical commentaries of her anonymous, albeit acknowledged cultural adviser. Overall, this is a delightful bedside companion. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Brokeback Mountain: Now a Major Motion Picture</h2><p>The friendship between Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys, gradually evolves into an intimate relationship while they are working together as a herder and camp tender and living a remote cabin, sharing a bond that spans many years and frequent separations, in a stand-alone story from the collection Close Range. Simultaneous. 10,000 first printing. (A Focus Features film, written by Larry McMurtry &amp; Diana Ossana, directed by Ang Lee, releasing December 2005, starring Jake Gyllenhaal &amp; Heath Ledger)</p><p><b>Annie Proulx</b> is the author of eight books, including the novel <i>The Shipping News</i> and the story collection <i>Close</i><i> Range</i>. Her many honors include a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, the Irish Times International Fiction Prize, and a PEN/Faulkner award. Her story &#x201c;Brokeback Mountain,&#x201d; which originally appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, was made into an Academy Award-winning film. Her most recent book is <i>Fine Just&nbsp;the Way It Is</i>.&nbsp;She lives in Wyoming.Originally published in THE NEW YORKER and then as part of the collection CLOSE RANGE, Annie Proulx's short story packs a punch. Cowboys Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar find love or something like it watching over a herd of sheep one summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Their lives diverge and intersect again and again as they simultaneously resist and are drawn into a doomed, impossible romance. Campbell Scott's clear reading puts Proulx's beautiful and harsh language front and center. The story is mostly straight narration, but there are a few chances for dialogue, and Scott gives the various characters subtle Western shading, with a gentle drawl for Jack and a gravelly growl for Ennis. It's a timeless story that stands up to repeated listening and will stay with listeners long after they've finished the hour-long CD.

A collection of four tales of outlandish, commonplace and surprising terror.</p><p><i>Different Seasons</i> (1982) is a collection of four novellas, markedly different in tone and subject, each on the theme of a journey. The first is a rich, satisfying, nonhorrific tale about an innocent man who carefully nurtures hope and devises a wily scheme to escape from prison. The second concerns a boy who discards his innocence by enticing an old man to travel with him into a reawakening of long-buried evil. In the third story, a writer looks back on the trek he took with three friends on the brink of adolescence to find another boy's corpse. The trip becomes a character-rich rite of passage from youth to maturity.<p> These first three novellas have been made into well-received movies: "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" into Frank Darabont's 1994 <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (available as a screenplay, a DVD film, and an audiocassette), "Apt Pupil" into Bryan Singer's 1998 film <i>Apt Pupil</i> (also released in 1998 on audiocassette), and "The Body" into Rob Reiner's <i>Stand by Me</i> (1986).</p><p> The final novella, "Breathing Lessons," is a horror yarn told by a doctor, about a patient whose indomitable spirit keeps her baby alive under extraordinary circumstances. It's the tightest, most polished tale in the collection. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947.

Scott Fitzgerald Hardback Collection)</h2><p>These sumptuous new hardback editions mark the 70th anniversary of Fitzgerald&#39;s death. Between the First World War and the Wall Street Crash, the French Riviera was the stylish place for wealthy Americans to visit. Among the most fashionable are the Divers, Dick and Nicole who hold court at their villa. Into their circle comes Rosemary Hoyt, a film star, who is instantly attracted to them, but understands little of the dark secrets and hidden corruption that hold them together. As Dick draws closer to Rosemary, he fractures the delicate structure of his marriage and sets both Nicole and himself on to a dangerous path where only the strongest can survive. In this exquisite, lyrical novel, Fitzgerald has poured much of the essence of his own life; he has also depicted the age of materialism, shattered idealism and broken dreams.</p><p>In the wake of World War I, a community of expatriate American writers established itself in the salons and cafes of 1920s Paris. They congregated at Gertrude Stein's select soirees, drank too much, married none too wisely, and wrote volumes--about the war, about the Jazz Age, and often about each other. F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were part of this gang of literary Young Turks, and it was while living in France that Fitzgerald began writing <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. Begun in 1925, the novel was not actually published until 1934. By then, Fitzgerald was back in the States and his marriage was on the rocks, destroyed by Zelda's mental illness and alcoholism. Despite the modernist mandate to keep authors and their creations strictly segregated, it's difficult <i>not</i> to look for parallels between Fitzgerald's private life and the lives of his characters, psychiatrist Dick Diver and his former patient turned wife, Nicole. Certainly the hospital in Switzerland where Zelda was committed in 1929 provided the inspiration for the clinic where Diver meets, treats, and then marries the wealthy Nicole Warren. And Fitzgerald drew both the European locale and many of the characters from places and people he knew from abroad.<p> In the novel, Dick is eventually ruined--professionally, emotionally, and spiritually--by his union with Nicole. Fitzgerald's fate was not quite so novelistically neat: after Zelda was diagnosed as a schizophrenic and committed, Fitzgerald went to work as a Hollywood screenwriter in 1937 to pay her hospital bills. He died three years later--not melodramatically, like poor Jay Gatsby in his swimming pool, but prosaically, while eating a chocolate bar and reading a newspaper. Of all his novels, <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is arguably the one closest to his heart. As he himself wrote, "<i>Gatsby</i> was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith."</p>In Tender Is The Night, Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture.</p><h2>Knit One, Felt Too: Discover the Magic of Knitted Felt with 25 Easy Patterns</h2><p><p>Easy enough for beginners and exciting enough to inspire experts, felted knitting offers endless possibilities for creative crafting.

The career con man who convincingly passed himself off as Rockefeller was born in a small village in Germany. At seventeen, obsessed with getting to America, he flew into the country on dubious student visa documents and his journey of deception began. <br><br> Over the next thirty years, boldly assuming a series of false identities, he moved up the social ladder through exclusive enclaves on both coasts-culminating in a stunning twelve-year marriage to a rising star businesswoman with a Harvard MBA who believed she'd wed a Rockefeller. <br><br> The imposter charmed his way into exclusive clubs and financial institutions-working on Wall Street, showing off an extraordinary art collection-until his marriage ended and he was arrested for kidnapping his daughter, which exposed his past of astounding deceptions as well as a connection to the bizarre disappearance of a California couple in the mid-1980s. <br><br> The story of <i>The Man in the Rockefeller Suit</i> is a probing and cinematic exploration of an audacious imposer-and a man determined to live the American dream by any means necessary.</p><p>Mark Seal is a contributing editor at <i>Vanity Fair</i>, where his piece on Gerhartsreiter was a finalist for a 2010 National Magazine Award.

He was Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, a forty-seven-year-old German immigrant who had come to America as a student in 1978. Shortly after his arrival, he disappeared into what the Boston district attorney would call &#x201c;the longest con I've seen in my professional career.&#x201d; The elaborate, labyrinthine nature of Gerhartsreiter's shapeshifting adventures, from the time he set foot in this country as a seventeen-year-old student right up to his disappearance, makes his story more bizarre than any gifted writer of fiction could possibly invent.</p><h2>The Interpretation of Financial Statements, Third Revised Edition</h2><p>First published in 1937, The Interpretation of Financial Statements is renowned for its clear, precise language and common sense explanations of financial terms and practices.

Yet, if you look beyond pat ideas about their cause, such as "alcoholism is a disease," nobody has really had an answer for why people with addictive behaviors continue to repeat them in the face of their awful consequences. This book offers an answer to the core "Why?" question of alcoholism and other addictions.</p><p>Dr. Dodes sets out to change the way completely we treat alcoholism and other addictions, including compulsive gambling and sexual addiction. He describes how all addictions have at their heart certain emotional/ psychological factors that, once understood, can be successfully managed. He shows how these factors can be turned to good use to find exactly what alternatives will work for <em>you<em> as an individual.

Between the predominance of 12-step programs and incorrect information issued by the press, thousands of people are getting misinformation instead of the help they need. Lance Dodes, in his book <i>The Heart of Addiction</i>, reexamines common myths and provides a world of new recommendations aimed at helping anyone with an addiction, be it to gambling, alcohol, or prescription medications. Rather than focusing on the specific object of addiction, he chooses instead to look at the common desires and emotions present in anyone with addiction issues. <p> Through years of private practice and work in substance-abuse clinics, Dodes has noticed a pattern behind addiction--a pattern of anger, helplessness, and shame, coupled with a desire for immediate escape from these feelings. In presenting multiple composite cases, he shows us repeatedly that addiction is more than an uncontrollable desire for the substances; it is a behavior pattern with deeply emotional roots. Included are detailed explanations of differences between physical tolerance, abuse, and addiction, as well as an unusual questionnaire that focuses on the underlying reasons for drinking, rather than the more traditional one that covers specific amounts, methods, and results of imbibing. Separate chapters discuss particular issues of teens and couples, and special recommendations for seeking treatment are also included. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>Lance Dodes, MD, is assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in the Division on Addictions.

His first novel, <i>Back Bay, </i>introduced Boston treasure hunter Peter Fallon, who is still tracking artifacts across the landscape of our national imagination. Martin's subsequent novels, including <i>Harvard Yard</i>,<i> Citizen Washington</i>, and <i>The Lost Constitution </i>have established him, as a "storyteller whose smoothness matches his ambition." (Publishers Weekly) He has also written an award-winning PBS documentary and one of the cheesiest horror movies ever made. Nevertheless, he was the recipient of the 2005 New England Book Award, given to "an author whose body of work stands as a significant contribution to the culture of the region." There are now over three million copies of his books in print. He has three grown children and lives near Boston with his wife</p>A big beach book is on the way with this sturdy, generation- spanning chronicle from Martin (Cape Cod, 1991, etc.), now telling the story of an archetypally American family bound to the US Navy and to its Maryland roots from colonial times to the present. From the start, the Staffords (who arrived in the New World in 1634) went down to the sea in ships and did business in great waters. Settling in both the Patuxent River Valley (to raise tobacco) and Annapolis, the tidewater family prospered. After the US gained independence, scions of the clan were blooded in the nascent Navy's campaign against Barbary Coast pirates and in action against British ships of the line during the War of 1812. Midshipman Jason Stafford survived these close encounters (as well as an idyllic stopover in the South Pacific's Marquesas Islands) to achieve high rank. During the Civil War, his sons served on Union gunboats and on Confederate raiders. Their largely male descendants went on to play supporting roles in the Spanish-American War, the founding of the Naval Academy, the Battle of Midway, and other turning-point events that marked America's emergence as a dominant naval power. Staffords also fought valiantly in the riverine jungles of Vietnam and, flying carrier-based attack planes, in the unfriendly skies over the Persian Gulf. Martin's long story is artfully kept within comprehensible limits by the latter-day activities of a maverick Stafford, liberal journalist Jack, who's writing a painfully detailed account of his family's odyssey, and by a distant cousin assigned to produce a PBS-TV special on the family. Their colloquies and inquiries provide continuity and perspective in a narrative whose serial protagonists are steeped in the tradition of doing violence with honor. A lively, engrossing saga that brings epic chapters of US history out of the archival hold into the bracing air of the quarterdeck.

Left in Boston by the H.M.S. Dolphin crew when they discover her true sex, Jacky Faber finds herself navigating entirely new waters. It turns out that bloodthirsty buccaneers have nothing on the young ladies at the Lawson Peabody School! As Jacky observes, "...they&#x2019;re like any bunch of thirty or so cats thrown in a sack and shaken up good. They&#x2019;re mean in ways that boys never even thought of being." It isn&#x2019;t long before Jacky shows her true colors by being arrested for "exposing a Female Part" (her knee) while jigging in the streets and is "busted down" to serving girl instead of student. Jacky soldiers on, getting herself into scrapes that her darling beau midshipman Jaimy Fletcher couldn&#x2019;t even begin to imagine, including uncovering a shady minister&#x2019;s evil secret and fixing a horse race with voodoo. And where in the world is seafaring Jaimy? As her letters to him continue to go unanswered, Jacky grows more and more worried. Still, at book&#x2019;s end she takes an assignment as "lady&#x2019;s companion" to the captain&#x2019;s wife aboard a whaler headed for London. Astute readers will notice that the whaler&#x2019;s crabby captain has a peg leg and won&#x2019;t be surprised if in the next Bloody Jack Adventure, Jacky ends up hunting the great white whale!<p> Utterly engaging and incredibly well-paced,<i>Curse of the Blue Tattoo</i> is the very best kind of historical fiction: the kind that won&#x2019;t leave teens snoring. Meyer effortlessly maintains Jacky&#x2019;s sassy voice and conflicted conscience in what is shaping up to be a great series.

But the Africans then living in the colonies overwhelmingly sided with the British. In this trailblazing book, Gerald Horne shows that in the prelude to 1776, the abolition of slavery seemed all but inevitable in London, delighting Africans as much as it outraged slaveholders, and sparking the colonial revolt. </p><p>Prior to 1776, anti-slavery sentiments were deepening throughout Britain and in the Caribbean, rebellious Africans were in revolt. For European colonists in America, the major threat to their security was a foreign invasion combined with an insurrection of the enslaved. It was a real and threatening possibility that London would impose abolition throughout the colonies - a possibility the founding fathers feared would bring slave rebellions to their shores. To forestall it, they went to war. </p><p>The so-called Revolutionary War, Horne writes, was in part a counter-revolution, a conservative movement that the founding fathers fought in order to preserve their right to enslave others. <i>The Counter-Revolution of 1776</i> brings us to a radical new understanding of the traditional heroic creation myth of the United States. </p></p><p><p><strong>Gerald Horne</strong> is Moores Professor of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston, and&nbsp;has published three dozen books including<em>, The Counter-Revolution of 1776:&nbsp; Slave Resistance and the Origins of the USA</em> and <em>Race War!&nbsp; White Supremacy and the Japanese Attack on the British Empire</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"Every person&nbsp;committed to the struggle for racial justice, liberation, and equality, and who struggles every day with the difficulties of forging unity between Black and white, needs to read this book."-<i>Portside.org<i></i><br><br>"Historian Horne makes the case that the War for Independence was in fact a conservative counter-revolution that sought to preserve slavery in North America."&nbsp;-<i>In These Times</i><br><br>"Horne&nbsp;returns with insights about the American Revolution that fracture even more some comforting myths about the Founding Fathers.&nbsp;The author does not tiptoe through history&#x2019;s grassy fields; he swings a scythe . . . .

You might guess that diet and exercise are important. Did you know that other factors like sleep and stress management can have just as much impact on your daily health and functioning? In <em>HealthStyle</em> Dr. Steven Pratt, dubbed "the Food Dude" by Oprah Winfrey, has expanded on his original thirteen SuperFoods and broadened his focus to include all aspects of health promotion. He covers such topics as:</p><ul><li>How ordinary spices like black pepper and cinnamon can make surprising contributions to health promotion</li><li>What the latest compelling research shows about how poor sleep habits could be sabotaging your efforts at weight control, reducing your cognitive abilities, and impairing your overall health</li><li>How achieving "personal peace" can prolong life and improve brain function</li><li>Why dark chocolate, honey, and kiwi have joined the ranks of SuperFoods</li><li>How the simplest imaginable exercise program can be the most effective</li><li>Why paying attention to one simple aspect of eating could be the answer to weight control</li></ul> <p><em>HealthStyle</em> is about extending the true quality of life.

For each season, they describe proven benefits of foods in abundance then and provide recipes combining them; they also focus throughout on specific concerns like diabetes, portion control and stress. Readers may occasionally struggle with dietary jargon that isn't always well explained (e.g., "phytochemicals" and "cryptoxanthins"), and those new to the SuperFood way might be overwhelmed by the amount of certain foods they're supposed to eat (a cup or two of blueberries per day in summer; one-half to one cup of broccoli daily in autumn), but the advice is sensible and the authors make no incredible claims. The recipes, mostly simple, range from breakfast items to light entrees to desserts and show ways the book's recommendations can be put into practice. Pratt and Matthews's system is basically the age-old one of restraint: eat fresh food in moderation and exercise. <i>(On sale Dec. 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book includes a gripping account of Drake's 1577-1580 voyage around the world and his audacious challenge to the Spanish (the author points out that King Philip's naval resources were roughly six times those of Elizabethan England), culminating in his preemptive strike at Cadiz in 1587 and his decisive action against the Armada in the English Channel a year later.

This eagerly awaited companion volume, by contrast, takes place in a village with only the most rudimentary technology, where anger, greed, envy, and casual cruelty make ordinary people's lives short and brutish. This society, like the one portrayed in <i>The Giver</i>, is controlled by merciless authorities with their own complex agendas and secrets. And at the center of both stories there is a young person who is given the responsibility of preserving the memory of the culture--and who finds the vision to transform it. <p> Kira, newly orphaned and lame from birth, is taken from the turmoil of the village to live in the grand Council Edifice because of her skill at embroidery. There she is given the task of restoring the historical pictures sewn on the robe worn at the annual Ruin Song Gathering, a solemn day-long performance of the story of their world's past. Down the hall lives Thomas the Carver, a young boy who works on the intricate symbols carved on the Singer's staff, and a tiny girl who is being trained as the next Singer. Over the three artists hovers the menace of authority, seemingly kind but suffocating to their creativity, and the dark secret at the heart of the Ruin Song. </p><p> With the help of a cheerful waif called Matt and his little dog, Kira at last finds the way to the plant that will allow her to create the missing color--blue--and, symbolically, to find the courage to shape the future by following her art wherever it may lead. With astonishing originality, Lowry has again created a vivid and unforgettable setting for this thrilling story that raises profound questions about the mystery of art, the importance of memory, and the centrality of love.

When Books One and Two of his latest masterpiece, &#34;1Q84&#34;, were published in Japan, a million copies were sold in one month, and the critical acclaim that ensued was reported all over the globe. Readers were transfixed by the mesmerising story of Aomame and Tengo and the strange parallel universe they inhabit. Then, one year later, to the surprise and delight of his readers, Murakami published an unexpected Book Three, bringing the story to a close. In order to reflect the experience of &#34;1Q84&#39;s&#34; first readers, Harvill Secker is publishing Books One and Two in one beautifully designed volume and Book Three in a separate edition. A long-awaited treat for his fans, &#34;1Q84&#34; is also a thrilling introduction to the unique world of Murakami&#39;s imagination. This hypnotically addictive novel is a work of startling originality and, as the title suggests, a mind-bending ode to George Orwell&#39;s &#34;Nineteen Eighty-Four&#34;. (The number 9 in Japanese is pronounced like the letter &#39;Q&#39;). The year is 1984. Aomame sits in a taxi on the expressway in Tokyo. Her work is not the kind which can be discussed in public but she is in a hurry to carry out an assignment and, with the traffic at a stand-still, the driver proposes a solution. She agrees, but as a result of her actions starts to feel increasingly detached from the real world. She has been on a top-secret mission, and her next job will lead her to encounter the apparently superhuman founder of a religious cult. Meanwhile, Tengo is leading a nondescript life but wishes to become a writer. He inadvertently becomes involved in a strange affair surrounding a literary prize to which a mysterious seventeen-year-old girl has submitted her remarkable first novel. It seems to be based on her own experiences and moves readers in unusual ways. Can her story really be true? Both Aomame and Tengo notice that the world has grown strange; both realise that they are indispensable to each other. While their stories influence one another, at times by accident and at times intentionally, the two come closer and closer to intertwining.</p><p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. He is the author of many novels as well as short stories and non-fiction. His works include Norwegian Wood, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Kafka on the Shore, After Dark and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. His work has been translated into more than forty languages, and the most recent of his many international honours is the Jerusalem Prize, whose previous recipients include J.M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V.S. Naipaul.&#34;His towering new novel, his magnum opus, a work on a par with Don DeLillo&#39;s Underworld or Roberto Bolano&#39;s 2666. &#34; -- Stephen Amidon Sunday Times &#34;It is a work of maddening brilliance and gripping originality, deceptively casual in style, but vibrating with wit, intellect and ambition.&#34; -- Richard Lloyd Parry The Times &#34;Critics have variously likened him to Raymond Carver, Raymond Chandler, Arthur C. Clarke, Don DeLillo, Philip K. Dick, Bret Easton Ellis and Thomas Pynchon - a roster so ill assorted as to suggest Murakami is in fact an original&#34; New York Times &#34;[1Q84] may become a mandatory read for anyone trying to get to grips with contemporary Japanese culture... [It is Murakami&#39;s] magnum opus.&#34; Japan Times &#34;Murakami has likened novel-writing to a waking dream and, in a sense, what his stories resemble is a man...trying to report his dark dreams back as unpretentiously as he can. The novels&#39; most arresting quality is that combination of intelligent earnestness with a sensibility that touches on genuine unnerving subject matter... 1Q84 involves doppelgangers, parallel worlds, alluringly enigmatic women, the occasional graphic sex scene and a distinctive blend of noir atmospherics, occult imagery and whimsical humour. The analogy of literature with dreams and alternative worlds is also brought to the fore. What 1Q84 seems to share with Orwell&#39;s dystopia is a concern with how fiction can come to dominate realist and take its place&#34; -- Ben Jeffery Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Dealings: A Political and Financial Life</h2><p>It was a German soldier&#x2019;s chance decision to reach for a cigarette and absently wave a car through a checkpoint outside Marseille in 1940 that allowed Felix Rohatyn and his Jewish family to escape from Nazi-occupied France. In the States, a chance summer job led him to the small, private investment bank of Lazard Fr�res, where he came under the tutelage of legendary financier Andr� Meyer. The summer job turned into an extraordinary fifty-year career. <br><br>Hailed as "the preeminent investment banker of his generation," Rohatyn was a creator of the merger-and-acquisition business that revolutionized investment banking and transformed the worlds of finance and entertainment. In this very personal account, Rohatyn takes us behind the headlines to offer readers a telling look at some of the era&#x2019;s most renowned figures in the worlds of finance, entertainment, and politics. We are alongside Rohatyn as he meets Steve Ross in the back of the funeral parlor Ross is managing as they strategize to take control of Warner Brothers, and in Andr� Meyer&#x2019;s art-filled apartment as they negotiate with Frank Sinatra. <br><br>We are with Rohatyn as he assists Harold Geneen of ITT weather a series of congressional investigations, and as he stays one step ahead of the canny Michael Ovitz as Matsushita attempts to win control of Lew Wasserman&#x2019;s Universal Pictures. We also watch Rohatyn defending shareholders&#x2019; interests as the RJR-Nabisco buyout becomes a cautionary tale of executive greed. <br><br>We have a front-row seat as Rohatyn and Governor Hugh Carey forge a desperation plan to save New York City from bankruptcy. And we accompany Rohatyn when he returns to Paris as the U.S. ambassador to the country he barely escaped alive as a young boy. <br><br>Full of headline-making revelations, insider stories, keen personal observations, and relevant financial wisdoms, <i>Dealings </i>is the page-turning story of a life well lived.</p><p>Felix Rohatyn is Special Advisor to the Chairman and CEO of the investment banking firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co.

It is a noise that immediately fills me with dread: someone is reaching out to me in the darkness with bad news. So it was with a measure of anxiety that, late one night in November 1987, I turned on the lamp on our bedroom table, leaned over toward the trilling phone, and picked up the receiver.<br><br>I was relieved to discover that the caller was my partner, Ira Harris. A gigantic man with an explosive temperament, Ira had dominated the investment banking business in Chicago as the resident partner of Salomon Brothers until I had succeeded in luring him to Lazard. The lateness of the hour, I knew, meant little to Ira; he was always doing business. I prepared myself for a report on some recent development that was too important to wait until morning.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just spoken to Ross Johnson,&#x201d; he announced without even a pretense of an apology for the lateness of his call. &#x201c;They want to meet us tomorrow for lunch in Atlanta.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew, of course, that Ross Johnson was the CEO of RJR Nabisco, the company that had been formed by the merger of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the world&#x2019;s second-largest cigarette manufacturer, and Nabisco, a major international grocery products company. But Johnson was neither a business nor a social acquaintance. And I was tired.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; I said with perhaps too much abruptness, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know him or his company. Do you really want me to do this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Ira nearly shouted. &#x201c;The management wants to do an LBO. They want us and Dillon Read to advise the board. Can you meet me there?&#x201d;<br><br>I just wanted to go back to sleep. &#x201c;Ira&#x2014;&#x201d; I started.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me know what flight you&#x2019;re on,&#x201d; he interrupted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you picked up in Atlanta.&#x201d; Without waiting for me to respond, he hung up.<br><br>And so with that call I became one of the initial participants in a complex and hard-fought deal that would be the largest LBO ever. It would involve a crowd of Wall Street&#x2019;s most renowned bankers, lawyers, and public relations specialists. It was also a transaction that would, notoriously, symbolize the extravagant greed that energized and shaped the financial marketplace in the 1980s. And by the time it was concluded, I would almost be regretting that I had ever reached across my bed to answer the phone that late November night.<br><br>RJR Nabisco had lavish headquarters&#x2014;a sprawling campus of enormous buildings gleaming like what seemed to be acres of polished marble. It had all been designed, I suspected, with the purpose of impressing visitors, and as I arrived at the meeting the next day I must admit that all the extravagance had the desired effect. I was impressed. Clearly, this was a very rich company, a conglomerate that had its own fleet of airplanes and sponsored golf and tennis tournaments with millions of dollars in prize money. But my banker&#x2019;s mind couldn&#x2019;t help wondering, How rich? On the plane ride down to Atlanta, I had worked out that at its present price of $55 a share, RJR was valued at about $16 billion. Yet not very long ago the stock had been trading at $76. The real market value price per share, I felt certain without even doing any due diligence, would be significantly higher. For the right price, the purchase of RJR Nabisco would be a very good investment. No wonder the Johnson group wanted to make a deal.<br><br>No sooner had I arrived at the headquarters then I was led into a meeting room. Charles Hugel, the chairman of RJR&#x2019;s executive committee, was sitting at the head of a long table. To his right, I recognized Peter Atkins, who was a senior partner at Skadden Arps, Meagher &amp; Flom, and one of the profession&#x2019;s leading M&amp;A lawyers. He was, I was told, acting as counsel to the executive committee. Ira and our colleagues from Dillion Read were also already seated.<br><br>Once I joined them, the meeting moved forward with surprising quickness. Hugel explained that the management of RJR, led by Ross Johnson, planned to propose an LBO of the company to the board of directors. The price was set at $75 a share, and Shearson Lehman Hutton, the investment bank advising the management, was confident that the financing could be arranged. A committee of independent directors, headed by Hugel, had been formed to review the fairness of this proposal. Lazard and Dillion Read would be the financial advisers to this special committee of the board; we would, assisted by Peter Atkins&#x2019;s legal advice, represent the shareholders&#x2019;s concerns.<br><br>Management, Hugel continued, was operating on a very tight timetable. But these top executives believed that the entire transaction could be swiftly concluded. After all, he pointed out, they were offering a premium of almost 40 percent over the current $55 share price. Of course, he concluded, there was undoubtedly some room for improving this initial bid. But there was every reason to believe that the special committee should be able to come to a prompt decision that was in the shareholders&#x2019; best interest. Two weeks, he suggested breezily, and the deal should, largely, be concluded.<br><br>I listened to Hugel and grew increasingly uncomfortable as he spoke. This would be one of the largest corporate transactions in the history of American business; certainly, it would be the biggest LBO. It was a deal in which management presumably would reap huge profits: a situation, I knew from past experience, that inevitably led to lawsuits from shareholders. In addition, a deal of this size involving a company whose products were household names would also attract the attention and scrutiny of the press. My every instinct was to be deliberate. Hugel&#x2019;s recitation struck me as too confident, too matter-of-fact. And the emphasis on speed made me extremely uneasy.<br><br>After conferring with Ira and the bankers from Dillon Read, I spoke. We would, I said, get to work immediately; a joint team was ready to begin doing due diligence. But, I emphasized, we would not guarantee that this process could be finished in the two weeks that had been suggested. Our responsibility was to see that the shareholders received the best price. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of the company and its components had to be done. And, since this was a transaction involving a potential purchase by insiders, we needed to provide sufficient opportunity for other bidders to step forward. Two weeks, I reiterated, was simply too little time.<br><br>Hugel seemed undisturbed by my reservations about his timetable. He just plowed on, showing us the press release describing management&#x2019;s purchase offer. It would be released immediately following the scheduled meeting later that day of the entire board. Then, he led us into the boardroom to meet with the special committee.<br><br>The boardroom, like everything at RJR, was gigantic. Seated around a table that looked nearly as long as the flight deck of an aircraft carrier were the members of the special committee. I had met many of these directors before. Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, was a client of Ira&#x2019;s and mine; I knew him to be a tough, demanding, and difficult man. Bill Anderson, chairman of NCR; and John Macomber, chairman of Celanese, were close acquaintances of mine. Vernon Jordan was (and still is) everyone&#x2019;s friend and counselor. Juanita Kreps, the only woman on the committee, had been secretary of commerce in the Carter administration. John Medlin was chairman of Wachovia Bank. This was a sophisticated group; and I was buoyed by the certainty that no matter what pressures were put on us by management and Charlie Hugel, the committee members would not be intimidated. They would insist on an open and fair bidding process&#x2014;and, if it was necessary, they would not allow their deliberations to be restricted to the proposed two-week timetable.<br><br>The directness of their questions reinforced my confidence. They wanted to know in great detail how we proposed to go about our task, and how often we would report to them. And they, too, expressed skepticism about a swift conclusion to the transaction.<br><br>When the committee members had finished with their questions, Peter Atkins spoke. With great deliberateness, he outlined the many legal issues involved in the transaction and the specific fiduciary responsibilities of the directors. He made it clear that management&#x2019;s participation in the equity of the new company would be disclosed not only to the board, but also to the public. In fact, he emphasized, to insulate the board members from litigation by stockholders, full disclosure in every aspect of this transaction was essential.<br><br>By the time I boarded the flight back to New York the next day, the press release detailing the management proposal led by Johnson had been distributed. When the plane landed, I called the office and learned that RJR stock had jumped nearly $17 in heavy volume. The company was now &#x201c;in play.&#x201d;<br><br>Leveraged buyouts&#x2014;LBOs&#x2014;were a popular financial strategy in the 1980s, and the theory behind them was quite simple. A publicly owned company with mediocre performance and a relatively low market value would prosper if it was privately owned, and management was part of the new ownership group. Only private ownership dominated by executives who knew the company, according to this financial logic, could take the necessary bold, long-term actions to improve business. There would be no pressure to report increased earnings each quarter, and costs could be cut by selectively selling or closing underperforming corporate units.<br><br>In a typical LBO, an investment group working with management would acquire the target company by providing its own capital and arranging for significant loans, often through junk bonds. The transaction would be highly leveraged; equity capital would generally be only 20 to 25 percent of the purchase price, and the large remaining portion would be debt. As assets were sold off, the proceeds would be used to pay down the debt to a more conventional amount. After two or three years, the company, now with a reduced debt and improved earnings, would return to the public markets at a significantly higher value for the underlying equity. And the LBO firm, the management-owners, and the holders of the junk bonds would stand to make a substantial profit on the relatively small sums they had invested.<br><br>The 1980s had seen an explosion in such transactions, with the deals steadily growing larger and larger. Beatrice Foods, General Instruments, Gulf Oil, Carnation, and Storer Broadcasting&#x2014;all were acquired through LBOs. The two leading, and very competitive, companies engineering LBOs were KKR, a company formed by three former M&amp;A executives at Bear Stearns&#x2014;Henry Kravis, Jerome Kohlberg, and George Roberts&#x2014;and Forstmann Little, an investment group headed by Ted Forstmann, his brother Tony, and Brian Little. Drexel, with its proven ability to sell junk bonds to institutional investors, would often provide the debt financing. But no transaction the size of RJR had ever been attempted.<br><br>If Shearson Lehman, the bankers working with the Ross Johnson group, could engineer this deal, it would be a tremendous coup for the firm. Not only would Shearson reap a huge payday for its efforts&#x2014;the fees alone on a deal of this size could total $200 million or more&#x2014;but it would also be a direct challenge to KKR&#x2019;s and Forstmann&#x2019;s dominance.<br><br>I wanted to believe that Henry Kravis was too competitive a businessman to be content simply to read about the biggest LBO in history in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. In fact, I wanted him to make a competing bid. It was my responsibility to get the shareholders the best price possible, and without KKR&#x2019;s stepping into the fray I doubted that we could find another bidder.<br><br>Yet I also had genuine concerns about KKR&#x2019;s participation. Drexel had traditionally provided the firm&#x2019;s junk bond financing. However, Drexel was now in its death throes. The SEC and federal prosecutors were deep into their very public investigation of Drexel and Michael Milken for insider trading, stock manipulation, and fraud, among a variety of other violations of security law. The besieged firm was no longer capable of providing significant financing for Kravis, or, for that matter, anyone else.<br><br>Without KKR&#x2019;s coming in with a competing bid, we, acting on behalf of the shareholders, would be left with two options: either a recapitalization of RJR, or selling the company in several pieces. But both of these approaches were full of uncertainties. I felt we could push the RJR management&#x2013;Shearson group to about $80 per share. To do better, however, we would need another bidder, and KKR seemed the only logical choice. But since Drexel could not provide the necessary debt financing, it was doubtful that KKR would step up. I was starting to think that maybe I had been wrong. Since there was only one bid, this transaction would, in fact, proceed as swiftly as Hugel had confidently predicted.<br><br>But even as I speculated anxiously about other bidders, I also knew we needed to begin our due diligence. On Saturday morning, the day after Ira and I arrived back in New York, our joint team set up a data room. If we were going to provide the shareholders with a value that would exceed management&#x2019;s bid of $75 per share, we needed to evaluate RJR on the basis of the sum of its parts. Would selling off some of the divisions and restructuring the company give the shareholders a combination of cash and stock that was worth more than $75? We also had to review all aspects of the RJR management bid, including, most important, the assurance that they could raise the necessary funds and the quality of their debt.<br><br>Lazard&#x2019;s members of the team included some of our best senior professionals: Bob Lovejoy would oversee the legal and regulatory aspects, while Luis Rinaldini and Josh Gotbaum would analyze the RJR numbers and derive values. Fritz Hobbs headed the Dillon Read group.<br><br>As we all gathered for the first time on that Saturday morning, what had started as an organizational meeting quickly turned into a valuation session. After only a few preliminaries, we began to speculate on what RJR was worth.<br><br>We all agreed: Shearson&#x2019;s $75 bid was a lowball offer. Ira and I, after just a cursory review of the numbers our people had gathered, believed that a valuation in the high $80s, or even as much as $90, could be achieved: that is, a sale price of $20 billion. Luis Rinaldini thought $100 per share was achievable, and possibly an even higher price.<br><br>Yet despite these lofty valuations, I remained discouraged. If there were no other suitors, the Johnson group would not be pressured to increase its initial offer. So, I considered corporate buyers. There were companies, such as Nestl�, Unilever, Philip Morris, and Coca-Cola, that certainly had the capability. However, I decided they would either be inhibited by antitrust concerns&#x2014;Philip Morris was already bidding for Kraft&#x2014;or be put off by the very real health issues raised by RJR&#x2019;s tobacco business. And once again, I thought about restructuring. But this still remained, I had to concede, a weak option. I doubted that the board would support such a risky plan.<br><br>Glumly, I began to imagine how all this would play out. We&#x2019;d get the Johnson-Shearson team to improve its offer to perhaps $80 a share, and the ...</p><h2>The Risk Pool</h2><p>A wonderfully funn and perceptive novel in the traditions of Thornton Wilder and Anne Tyler, <b>The Risk Pool</b> is set in Mohawk, New York, where Ned Hall is doing his best to grow up, even though neither of his estranged parents can properly be called adult.<br><br>His father, Sam, cultivates bad habits so assiduously that he is stuck at the bottom of his auto insurance risk pool.

No more scouring used-book stores for tattered copies to replace the ones you loaned your friends: the first two installments of S.M. Stirling's superlative military-SF/alternate-history <i>Draka</i> trilogy are back in print, bound along with the third installment in hardcover. The only downside to this collection--which spans <i>Marching Through Georgia</i>, <i>Under the Yoke</i>, and <i>The Stone Dogs</i>--is the disappointing omission of the helpful maps, glossary, and so on that appeared in the original editions. But as some consolation, we at least get a bit of new backstory for the pseudo-sequel to <i>Stone Dogs</i>, <i>Drakon</i>, in the form of a prologue and a few interspersed paragraphs bookending each title.<p> The Draka series (dubbed <i>The Domination</i> in this collection) still requires a strong stomach--you'll find no shortage of blood and bullets or sex and violence here.

A skilled writer and rigorous thinker, he's spun a compelling--not to mention plausible and well-researched--alternate history for earth: in this timeline, the Loyalists losers in the American Revolution set up shop in South Africa and then proceed to subjugate and industrialize the continent, eventually exporting their brutal system of slavery and conquest through WWI, WWII, and beyond to cover the better part of the globe.

The vast crumbling castle to which the seventy-seventh Earl, Titus Groan, is Lord and heir. Titus is expected to rule this Gothic labyrinth of turrets and dungeons, cloisters and corridors as well as his eccentric and wayward subjects. Over the course of these three novels-"Titus Groan," "Gormenghast," and" Titus Alone"--Titus must contend with a kingdom about to implode beneath the weight of centuries of intrigue, treachery, manipulation, and murder. <br> Peake has been compared to Dickens and Tolkien, but the Gormenghast trilogy is unique. This true classic is a feast of words unlike anything else in the world of fantasy, and those who explore Gormenghast castle will be richly rewarded. <br>Overlook is publishing this definitive volume to mark the centenary of the author's birth.</p><p>Mervyn Peake's <i>Gormenghast</i> trilogy has grown out of its reputation as a cult classic and into the mainstream of fantasy, as a book no reader interested in Gothic dare to miss. It is one of the most distinctive, absorbing and wonderfully <i>strange</i> books ever written. The story concerns Titus, heir to and afterwards 77th Earl of Groan and his adventures in the sprawling, crumbling castle of Gormenghast. Gormenghast is an entire world and Titus comes to grips with his prime antagonist, the sinister kitchenboy Steerpike, amongst a brilliant profusion of characters and vivid detail. Peake's work is rarely compared with that other great fantasy trilogy to come out of the immediately post-war years, Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> but in ways the two works do go together. Although Tolkien is plain and expansive where Peake is elaborate, poetic and inward-looking, both authors nonetheless use a detailed imaginative escapism in order to talk about the concerns of their day--specifically the passing of the old certainties of traditional England and the coming of something new. "'Equality is the great thing', said the sinister Steerpike, pulling the legs off a stag beetle and preparing to take on the whole hierarchy of Gormenghast, 'equality is everything'." This is why the short, surreal oddity of <i>Titus Alone</i>, the third novel, is the best: finally leaving his castle home Titus finds the larger world stranger even than his birthplace.<p>The new television series, with which this edition ties in, promises great things but the best part of Mervyn Peake is to be found in his ornate, poetic writing; his grasp of the Dickensian oddities of character and the utterly unique atmosphere of the books. --<i>Adam Roberts</i></p>"Peake's books are actual additions to life; they give, like certain rare dreams, sensations we never had before, and enlarge our conception of the range of possible experience."<br>-- C.S.

And small wonder! This enthralling tale is jam-packed with the things we long for in a great adventure: danger, laughter, hairbreath excapes, tragedy, mystery, a touch of wonder, a truly despicable villain, and a hero we can take to heart. That hero is Matthias, a young mouse who must rise above his fears and failures to save his friends at Redwall Abbey. The villain is Cluny the Scourage, one of the most deliciously despicable rats of all time. The unforgettable cast of supporting characters includes the stalwart badger Constance, an irrepressible hare named Basil Stag Hare, and the elderly wisemouse Brother Methuselah. But most of all there is Matthias, seeking his true destiny in a journey that will lead through danger and despair to true wisdom.</p><p></p><h2>Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco</h2><p><b>A long-overdue paean to the predominant musical form of the 70s and a thoughtful exploration of the culture that spawned it</b><br><br>Disco may be the most universally derided musical form to come about in the past forty years. Yet, like its pop cultural peers punk and hip hop, it was born of a period of profound social and economic upheaval. In <i>Turn the Beat Around</i>, critic and journalist Peter Shapiro traces the history of disco music and culture. From the outset, disco was essentially a shotgun marriage between a newly out and proud gay sexuality and the first generation of post-civil rights African Americans, all to the serenade of the recently developed synthesizer. Shapiro maps out these converging influences, as well as disco's cultural antecedents in Europe, looks at the history of DJing, explores the mainstream disco craze at it's apex, and details the long shadow cast by disco's performers and devotees on today's musical landscape. <br><br>One part cultural study, one part urban history, and one part glitter-pop confection, <i>Turn the Beat Around</i> is the most comprehensive study of the Me Generation to date.<br></p><p><b>Peter Shapiro</b>'s writing on music has appeared in <i>Spin</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>The Wire</i>, and <i>The Times</i> (London). He is the author of the <i>Rough Guides</i> to, respectively, <i>Hip-Hop</i>, <i>Essential Soul</i>, and<i> Drum 'N' Bass</i>.<br>Few pop-music genres have so dominated the charts and airwaves as disco at its height; fewer still have subsequently been so reviled. Shapiro considers disco as much more than glitzy dance music with fashion ramifications. Emerging at a time when gay sexuality and rights were exploding and African Americans were entering the "post Civil Rights" era, disco combined elements of the subcultures of both. Shapiro describes how disco grew from roots stretching from World War II, became a worldwide phenomenon, and ended in a homophobic, racist backlash. High points in passing include Shapiro's incisive disquisition on how <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> had "more popular culture impact than any movie since <i>Gone with the Wind</i>." Shapiro cites record producer Nile Rodgers: "Those songs are powerful . . . just as relevant and as valid . . . as when the Sex Pistols . . . Pink Floyd [or] the Beatles are delivering a message." Let the pop-culture wars begin anew, with Shapiro's deeper, more balanced take on disco vitally informing the discussion. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Scientists are beginning to explore this fascinating realm of unusual sea creatures and volatile volcanos, using once-secret military technology now freed up by the end of the Cold War. See the timeline for a short history of this. In the Universe Below, William Broad takes a fresh look at this recent surge of exploration and discovery, and brings his readers along on some of his journeys into the deep. <p>In 1993, author William Broad joined scientists on a two-week expedition off the Oregon/Washington coast. Their aim was to examine the Juan de Fuca Ridge and to study how volcanic heat spawns life on the ocean floor. The crew voyaged 250 miles off-shore on a 210-feet long carrier ship, The Atlantis II, which each day lowered three members 1.5 miles into the deep via Alvin, a 25-feet long submersible vessel. <br>* * *<br> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td>Links </td><td>Meet Alvin<br> Garden of Eden<br> Chimneys of the Deep Sea<br> A Brief Chronology of Sea Exploration<br> </td></tr></tbody></table> <br>* * *<br> <p>Pulitzer Prize winner William J. Broad takes us on an epic journey to the planet's last and most exotic frontier -- the depths of the sea. The Universe Below examines how we are illuminating its dark recesses in a rush of discovery, uncovering hidden worlds of alien creatures, living fossils, lost treasures, precious metals, and perhaps even the place where life itself first arose billions of years ago. </p><p>Broad takes us on breathtaking dives and expeditions -- to the Azores, to the Titanic,., to hot springs teeming with bizarre life, to icy fissures aswarm with gulper eels, vampire squids, and gelatinous beasts longer than a city bus. We meet legendary explorers at the forefront of deep research and go with them as they probe the ancient mysteries of the deep. This universe below encompasses the vast majority of the Earth's habitable space and nurtures perhaps ten times as many species of life as are known on land. Broad shows that the abyss also holds millions of humanity's lost artworks and treasures -- more than all the world's museums combined. Yet, remarkably, human eyes up to now have glimpsed perhaps only a billionth of this unfamiliar realm, a place of crushing pressure and eternal darkness. </p><p>Drawing on extensive fieldwork, including hundreds of talks and interviews, Broad takes us to the cutting edge of the exploratory surge and reveals how it is powered by a wave of once-secret technologies. At a cost of untold billions, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and othercold-war contestants forged these marvels to spy and fight and plunder the deep. Today, these wonders and the poeple who made and ran them are catalyzing an unprecedented speedup in civilian efforts to illuminate the inky depths. </p><p>Broad shows how the rush into the deep is revealing not only great mysteries and riches but great dangers as well, including the deadly radioactive debris of the cold war. Deep pollution, mining, and fishing threaten this frontier with ecological upset and species extinction. We will either destroy the sea through ignorance or save it, and ourselves, with the kinds of knowledge we are now gaining in the exploratory speedup. </p><p>The Universe Below is an unforgettable journey to the universe in our own backyard.</p></p><p>Sometimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction. Fifty-foot-long sea serpents do exist, as it turns out, though without the baneful intentions that mythology has ascribed to them. <i>The Universe Below</i> examines the awe-inspiring and little-known worlds that lurk in the deep seas, often more than a mile beneath the waves. Author William Broad gives a highly personal account of undersea explorations that scouted out everything from bizarre life forms feeding off of scalding vents at the bottom of the ocean to 16th-century shipwrecks filled with cultural artifacts and perhaps even gold. Broad's book is meticulously researched and full of surprising discoveries about the unseen undersea world.William J. Broad William J.

Rudolph covers organized crime for Newark's Star-Ledger. Once the FBI had admitted, during the mid-70's, that there was such a thing as the mafia, it began insinuating undercover agents into crime families, especially--in the mid-80's--into the Lucchese family, which had a lock on New Jersey rackets such as loan- sharking, gambling, fraud, extortion, and drug-dealing. Masterminded by FBI agent Dennis Marchalonis, the government operation was carried on with such enormous secrecy--it had been decided to make a case against an entire crime family and wipe it out all at once, a historic decision--that FBI agents might find themselves under surveillance by two or three other legal agencies. When the secret task force finally had its evidence--gathered from wiretaps, informants, and agents--it rounded up the entire Lucchese family, then headed by Anthony (``Tumac'') Accetturo and Michael (``Mad Dog'') Taccetta, and brought indictments against 21 defendants. The government had a strong case and assembled a terrific team of prosecutors, led by hot-tempered, aggressive V. Gray O'Malley, who had never lost a case. The defense had a huge, strong, smartly chosen team as well. The flaw in the federal case was its size and the nearly two years it took to prosecute before a jury so wearied by picayune detail and evidence wandering off on endless tangents--with the jury's families under intense scrutiny all the while--that long before the 21 cases went to the jury, the jury had decided not to convict--in part, says Rudolph, to spite the government for having put it through such an ordeal.

Amidst all the jewels, and velvet and coronets, and the fine uniforms, she exuded an unworldly simplicity. Seated with the royal family, she was a part of them, yet somehow distanced from them. Inasmuch as she is remembered at all today, it is as this shadowy figure in gray nun's clothes..."<br><br>Princess Alice, mother of Prince Phillip, was something of a mystery figure even within her own family. She was born deaf, at Windsor Castle, in the presence of her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and brought up in England, Darmstadt, and Malta.<br><br>In 1903 she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and from then on her life was overshadowed by wars, revolutions, and enforced periods of exile. By the time she was thirty-five, virtually every point of stability was overthrown. Though the British royal family remained in the ascendant, her German family ceased to be ruling princes, her two aunts who had married Russian royalty had come to savage ends, and soon afterwards Alice's own husband was nearly executed as a political scapegoat.<br><br>The middle years of her life, which should have followed a conventional and fulfilling path, did the opposite. She suffered from a serious religious crisis and at the age of forty-five was removed from her family and placed in a sanitarium in Switzerland, where she was pronounced a paranoid schizophrenic. As her stay in the clinic became prolonged, there was a time where it seemed she might never walk free again. How she achieved her recovery is just one of the remarkable aspects of her story.<br></p><p>Hugo Vickers was born in 1951 and educated at Eton and Strasbourg University. His books include <i>Gladys, Duchess of Marlborough; Cecil Beaton; Vivien Leigh; Loving Garbo; Royal Orders; The Private World of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; </i>and <i>The Kiss</i>, which won the 1996 Stern Silver Pen for Non-fiction. He is an acknowledged expert on the royal family, appears regularly on television, and has lectured all over the world. Hugo Vickers and his family divide their time between London and a manor house in Hampshire.<br>A chain-smoking, nearly deaf princess who ministered to the sick in Greek hospitals and soup kitchens, was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic at age 45, fancied herself a nun and sheltered a Jewish family during the Holocaust (for which she was posthumously given the title Righteous among the Nations, an honor Oskar Schindler also received), Alice is a biographer's dream. Born under the watchful eye of her great-grandmother Queen Victoria in Windsor Castle in 1885, Alice married a Greek prince who was actually Danish, German and Russian. And while she was devoted to Greece, she and her royal in-laws were never fully accepted by their adopted subjects. At age 84, she died in Buckingham Palace, where she lived at the end of her life at the behest of her youngest child and only son, Prince Philip, and his wife, Queen Elizabeth. This is the first biography of Alice, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better or more comprehensive job than Vickers, an authority on Europe's royals whose previous subjects include the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. By crafting the perfect blend of juicy gossip and historical details, Vickers makes it abundantly clear why Alice deserves to be known as more than just the queen's mother-in-law. Among the more memorable images he captures: the ill-fated Czar Nicholas of Russia, who was married to Alice's Aunt Alix, pelting his niece with a bag of rice and a shoe at her 1903 wedding. Never one to shrink from a challenge, Alice caught the shoe and used it to hit her uncle on the head. 16 pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Paul Meets Bernadette</h2><p><b>Visual humor sweetens an artful tale about a fish who suddenly sees everything a new way &#x2014; thanks to a charismatic companion.</b><br><br>Paul is a fish who used to go around in circles.

Until one day Bernadette drops in and shows Paul that there is a whole world out there, right outside his bowl, with so many things to see. A banana-shaped boat! A blue elephant with a spoutlike trunk (be quiet when she&#x2019;s feeding her babies)! A lovely lunetta butterfly, with tortoise-shell rims! Simple saturated paintings play off this charming ode to an active imagination &#x2014; and the way that life changes when a bewitching creature opens your eyes.</p><p><b>Rosy Lamb</b> is a painter and sculptor.

With his trusty purple crayon in hand he goes to visit them.</p> <p>Harold quickly finds himself in all sorts of trouble! He meets some unfriendly dinosaurs and is even chased by hot lava. Luckily, Harold is quick on his feet and quick on the draw. He is able to save himself and all his new prehistoric friends.</p> <p>Generations of children have enjoyed Harold's imaginative adventures. This engaging new story will delight fans, old and new.</p></p><p>PreS-Gr. 1. Looking at his dinosaur book, Harold decides that he'd like to ride a dinosaur, so he sets out to find one by drawing a jungle. He meets several dinosaurs, saves some from a lava flow and one from a pool of tar, rides on one's back, then goes home. In the illustrations, which appear to be digital, Harold's room is shown in muted tones, while the dinosaur terrain is usually depicted in bright, saturated colors. Though Harold carries his purple crayon around wherever he goes, it's more of an identifying prop than an essential, creative tool that Harold wields to define the setting and characters and determine the action. With a story "based on a teleplay," this picture book will disappoint fans of Crockett Johnson's magical little books, though it may satisfy fans of the HBO series. They won't know what they're missing. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>PreSchool-Grade 2-The youngster's amazing purple crayon draws him into yet another adventure in this book based on the HBO animated series of Harold's adventures (with no mention of Crockett Johnson's name in it). When the child can't sleep, he decides to read his favorite book in bed. Wondering what it would be like to ride "a big, long-necked dinosaur," he picks up his purple crayon to find out. Naturally, one thing leads to another as Harold explores the jungle, drops into a pterodactyl's nest, and saves the dinosaurs from an erupting volcano. Though this story is not as fresh as Crockett Johnson's original, Harold's imaginative mind and the dinos are a winning combination, providing plenty of child appeal.

A moving testimony to the relevance of Christ, who, for Archimandrite Sophrony, is &#34;all, and in all, the beginning and the ending&#34; of all things.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Pursuit: A Novel</h2><p>Thirteen bodies are discovered inside a small Louisville restaurant just after closing time. The ferocity and apparent randomness of the crime prompt the police to call in criminology professor Daniel Millikan-they want a profile of the murderer. Millikan determines that the crime was committed not by a psychopath but by a professional killer of consummate skill and total lack of feeling: &#x201c;I think that the one who did it is one of the special cases. He&#x2019;s somebody we can&#x2019;t afford to have walking down a street where our families walk.&#x201d; When Millikan learns that the investigation has come to a complete standstill, he commits himself to an unorthodox decision. The only hope of stopping this killer and ending the bloodshed is to employ Roy Prescott, an expert in the narrow specialty of hunting down murderers through methods the police can&#x2019;t-and wouldn&#x2019;t-use.<br><br>And so begins a stunning novel by Thomas Perry, &#x201c;one of the most thoroughly satisfying writers around&#x201d; (Lawrence Block), a death match fought from one end of the country to the other by two enemies who both understand that only one of them will be alive at the end.</p><p>Thomas Perry's <i>Pursuit</i> is a dark tale of two killers, one a cold- blooded hit man and the other, the hero, something much murkier. When 13 people are mowed down in a restaurant, a police consultant realizes that it's the work of a professional who's tried to make a contract hit look like a random mass killing. Enter Roy Prescott, an expert in hunting down criminals using methods generally frowned on by law enforcement. Prescott uses the national media and the unknown killer's ego to draw his attention, then plays a game of cat-and- mouse with him in which the stakes quickly grow higher. Perry, best-known for his fine Jane Whitefield series, has a precise feel for characters who work for vengeance and justice outside the law, and Prescott easily gains the reader's sympathy while maintaining his bad-guy, good-guy mystique.<p> <i>Pursuit</i> may draw some comparisons with Lawrence Block's wry <i>Hit Man</i> and <i>Hit List</i>, but while Block is always excellent, it's Perry's work that'll have you waking up in a cold sweat. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><b>Praise for Thomas Perry<br></b><br>&#x201c;[Thomas Perry is a] master of nail-biting suspense.&#x201d; <br>-<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Perry never lets up on the suspense . . . masterful.&#x201d;<br><i>-Booklist</i>, about <b>Death Benefits</b><br><br>&#x201c;Explosive . . . the breathless, knowing prose is pitch-perfect.&#x201d;<br> -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, about <b>Dance for the Dead<br></b><br>&#x201c;Thomas Perry just keeps getting better.&#x201d;<br>-Tony Hillerman, about <b>Sleeping Dogs</b><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating tale written by one of America&#x2019;s finest storytellers.&#x201d;<br>-<i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, about <b>Shadow Woman</b><br><br>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s writing is as sharp as a sushi knife.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, about<b> Blood Money</b><br><br>&#x201c;As beautifully crafted as a good automatic weapon.&#x201d;<br>-Martin Cruz Smith, about <b>Sleeping Dogs</b><br><br>&#x201c;Dazzles like a house of mirrors.&#x201d;<br>-Martha Grimes, about <b>Shadow Woman</b><br><br>&#x201c;Thomas Perry is truly an original.&#x201d;<br>-Jonathan Kellerman<br><br> &#x201c;Terrific . . . dazzling ingenuity.&#x201d;<br>-<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, about <b>The Face-Changers</b></p><h2>Kathy Little Bird: A Mrs. Mike Novel</h2><p>Her Cree heritage and the legacy of her grandmother, Mrs. Mike, serve Kathy Little Bird well as she rises to fame as a country music singer during the 1970s and struggles to cope with the shattering trials, tragedies, and sorrows of her life. By the authors of Mrs. Mike.</p><p>Benedict and Nancy Freedman are at work on more sequels that take the characters of Mrs. Mike into the present day.More than 50 years after the popular <i>Mrs. Mike</i>, the third in the series focuses on Mrs. Mike's granddaughter, Kathy, who was born to a Cree mother and an Austrian soldier who separated shortly after her birth. The saga traces Kathy's journey from western Canada to Minnesota, Chicago, New York, and Montreal as she follows her dream of singing the Cree songs she learned from her mother and Elk Woman, her beloved mentor. Kathy's mother dies when she is but 17. She then abruptly marries a con artist, one of several hasty decisions, including giving her newborn daughter to their childless landlords because her ne'er-do-well husband convinces her it's for the best. Kathy experiences huge success, rejection, the loss of a lover, and finally devastating illness but never loses her love for singing. "I sang the years, I sang death, I sang rebirth, I sang it all," she tells herself. The Freedmans present a moving family saga and a paean to Native American values, nicely linking their three decades-spanning novels. <i>Deborah Donovan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It's the art of anticipating your opponent's next moves, knowing full well that your rival is trying to do the same thing to you. Though parts of game theory involve simple common sense, much is counterintuitive, and it can only be mastered by developing a new way of seeing the world. Using a diverse array of rich case studies&#x2015;from pop culture, TV, movies, sports, politics, and history&#x2015;the authors show how nearly every business and personal interaction has a game-theory component to it. Are the winners of reality-TV contests instinctive game theorists? Do big-time investors see things that most people miss? What do great poker players know that you don't? Mastering game theory will make you more successful in business and life, and this lively book is the key to that mastery.</p><p><p><strong>Avinash K. Dixit</strong> is Emeritus John J.F.

It is aimed at the serious listener, that is, someone who may not have had any formal lessons himself in this performing art, but who, nevertheless, has picked up an initial interest in listening to classical music, and is, therefore, seeking to know more about its underlying structure, system and traditions. By explaining in a straightforward and extremely readable style, the basic features of Indian music, how time and melody are structured, the main principles of raga delineation and development, and the various genres and styles of vocal as well as instrumental performances, the book aims to enhance the serious listener&#39;s understanding of Hindustani music.

She has also written a novel, <i>America's Dream</i> , and has co-edited two anthologies of Latino literature. She lives in Westchester County, New York.A beguiling record of a tremendous journey, epic in its own way, from childhood in a vibrant Puerto Rican barrio to triumph at Harvard, with a defining pause in a drab Brooklyn along the way. Now a filmmaker with her own company, Santiago, eldest of 11 children, was born in a rural barrio. Her parents--the beautiful, ambitious Mami and the frustrated artist Papi--weren't married, a source of constant family tension in her childhood. Meanwhile, the family lived in a house made of rippled metal sheets, ``a giant version of the lard cans used to haul water from public fountains,'' and grew its own fruits and vegetables. But despite the crudeness, there was room to play, fresh air, and a freedom that would never be replicated in their subsequent homes as the author's mother, tiring of Papi's infidelities, moved the children time and again to town, into lodgings or relatives' homes, until reconciliations brought everyone together again. The reconciliations grew more and more infrequent, however, and Santiago, a good student, had to change schools and suffer the jeers of city-bred children, as well as adjust to the often harsh regimens imposed by the differing households she was forced to live in. Finally, after Papi categorically refused to marry her, Mami decided--after traveling to N.Y.C. with one of the children, who needed medical treatment--to move to Brooklyn. But the new house proved to be a menacing place, where ``even snow was dangerous'' as children threw deadly snow-covered rocks at one another. Santiago was ambitious, though, determined to get out of Brooklyn ``and desperate to feel grass under [my] feet instead of pavement.'' She finally got her wish by excelling academically and winning a place in New York's High School of Performing Arts. Cleareyed, quietly powerful, and often lyrical: a story of true grit. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Not one for retiring to earthy pastures, Slocum rebuilt a hundred-year old sloop and set off from Boston in 1895 on the first single-handed circumnavigation of the globe. For more than three years, Slocum battled stormy seas, attacks from raiders and pirates, and of course, loneliness. He crossed the Atlantic no fewer than three times, spent weeks thrashing against the elements around Cape Horn, and found shelter in numerous exotic harbours.

He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the Spray.<p><b>From Dennis A. Berthold&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Sailing Alone Around the World</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing in sea literature like <i>Sailing Alone Around the World</i>, nor can there ever be again. Only one man was the first to sail around the world alone, and only one book recounts that astonishing voyage in his own words. This is that book.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Joshua Slocum left Boston on April 24, 1895, to sail around the world alone in the <i>Spray</i>, a 37-foot sloop he reconstructed himself, Mabel Wagnalls wrote in his log, The Spray will come back&#x201d; (Teller, <i>Joshua Slocum</i>, p. 77; see For Further Reading&#x201d;). Those words proved prophetic in more ways than one. Of course the <i>Spray</i> did come back three years later, anchoring on June 27, 1898, in Newport, Rhode Island. No one had ever circumnavigated the globe alone until Slocum did it, and not many have done so since. The <i>Spray</i> has also returned in the hundreds of full-sized replicas Slocum fans have built over the last century, many of them amazingly precise. Two books, Kenneth Slack&#x2019;s<i> In the Wake of the Spray</i> (1966) and R. Bruce Roberts-Goodson&#x2019;s <i>Spray: The Ultimate Cruising Boat</i> (1995), have documented this phenomenon, which began in 1903 and continues to the present. Between 1969 and 1995, Roberts-Goodson sold more than 5,000 sets of plans for <i>Spray</i> replicas of various sizes, and more than 800 of these have actually been built (Roberts-Goodson, p. viii). Hundreds of additional pleasure craft have been based on the <i>Spray</i>&#x2019;s general lines and rig, and there are probably several thousand more inspired, to one degree or another, by Slocum&#x2019;s modest sloop. Less ambitious Slocum fans can find kits in any good hobby store and build their own model at home. Right now, somewhere on the world&#x2019;s oceans, someone is sailing a version of the <i>Spray</i> and keeping alive the remarkable story of a little boat that sailed around the world with only one crew member, the dauntless Yankee skipper Joshua Slocum.</p><p>As important as are the material reincarnations of the <i>Spray</i>, her voyage would be far less memorable if she had not also returned as a literary artifact, the inspiration and heroine, if you will, of one of the greatest sea narratives ever written. Like the <i>Spray</i>, <i>Sailing Alone Around the World</i> is Slocum&#x2019;s original creation, and it has enjoyed a long life in many editions, reprintings, and retellings. It first appeared in serial form in <i>Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</i>, a popular periodical published in New York. As soon as the magazine series ended, Slocum&#x2019;s tale was produced in book form, complete with the <i>Century</i> illustrations by Thomas Fogarty and George Varian. It sold 7,000 copies in its first year, and its original edition eventually sold more than 27,000 copies (Teller,<b> </b>pp. 179, 176). Since 1956 it has been widely available in paperback editions, including a dozen or so for young readers. Excerpts are frequently included in anthologies of nautical writing. It has been translated into Swedish, Polish, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Czech, and in 2003 and 2004, Japanese and Chinese. There is probably no time during its history that it has been out of print, an honor it shares with such American classics as Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> (1852) and Mark Twain&#x2019;s <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> (1884). Portions of the book are frequently anthologized, and its durability has kept Slocum&#x2019;s other extended sea narrative, <i>Voyage of the Liberdade </i>(1890), before the public as well. Slocum has his own author society, an active group of sailors, shipbuilders, and lovers of nautical literature who honor his boat, his book, and his remarkable feat with regattas, awards, a journal and newsletter, and various memorabilia, all available on the society&#x2019;s website (see For Further Reading&#x201d;).<b></b></p><p>So for all his seeming obscurity in the world of American literature, Slocum&#x2019;s journey has fostered a world unto itself, a place where dedicated men and women spend years studying details of his boat; rebuilding it out of wood, fiberglass, reinforced concrete, aluminum, or steel; replicating his journey in whole or in part; and reading again and again the story of his amazing voyage.</p><p>Given such interest in the man and his boat, one would think we would know more about him today. He has been favored with a tireless biographer, Walter Magnes Teller, who assembled most of the key facts and documents in Slocum&#x2019;s life and interviewed Slocum&#x2019;s remaining family in the 1950s. Besides <i>Sailing Alone</i>, Slocum left a small published legacy of two additional accounts of voyages; a souvenir pamphlet about the <i>Spray</i>; a few unpublished letters to his editors, government officials, family, and friends; and scattered newspaper interviews with inquisitive journalists. Teller has collected and published most of this material, and after reading it our first impression is that we know this man as we would a traveling companion. Throughout <i>Sailing Alone</i> Slocum appears honest, forthright, and direct, like Henry David Thoreau in <i>Walden</i> (1854), a man who cared more for truth than money, love, or fame. Slocum is much more modest and unassuming than Thoreau, however. His writing style is straightforward and lucid, his nautical terminology is appropriate and precise, and he achieves a consistent humor by gently mocking himself as well as others. He admits his shortcomings as well as his accomplishments, as when he confesses to getting lost at Cape Horn, or feeling anxious about lecturing, or being so afraid of meeting pirates in the Mediterranean that he completely reverses his itinerary by sailing west around Cape Horn instead of going east through the Suez Canal. Thoreau described how he single-handedly built a cabin for only $28.12�; similarly, Slocum describes building the <i>Spray</i> for only $553.62. But Thoreau does not include any plans. Slocum does, along with a detailed account of how he built the boat. His diagrams of the <i>Spray</i>&#x2019;s profile, deck plan, and rigging are reprinted in nearly every edition. They lend his narrative authenticity and credibility and reinforce the impression of Slocum&#x2019;s sincerity. He presents himself as the real thing, an honest-to-goodness Yankee ship captain with a yarn to share and the salty language for telling it.</p></p><h2>Girl with Curious Hair</h2><p><p>Until his death in 2008, David Foster Wallace was one of the most prodigiously talented and original young writers in America, and "Girl with Curious Hair" displays the full range of his gifts. From the eerily real, almost holographic evocations of historical figures like Lyndon Johnson, over-televised game show hosts, and late-night comedians, to the title story, where terminal punk nihilism meets Young Republicanism, Wallace renders the incredible comprehensible, the bizarre normal, the absurd hilarious, and the familiar strange."</p></p><p>David Foster Wallace is one of the most prodigiously talented young writers in America today and has received numerous awards for his work.

Truly funny surreal humour. * San Francisco Chronicle * It is his prose that really sets him apart; sometimes eerily banal, at others so densely observed you&#39;re scared to blink, and making ordinary situations seem strangely disconnnected from reality. Cleverness and verbosity are additional key ingredients, and the effect is often brilliant. * SCOTLAND ON SUNDAY * Puncturing the veneer of power lies at the crux of this collection, and attention to detail illuminates the banal. Wallace&#39;s control of different voices is superb, given the individual style of each tale. * THE TIMES * This collection of ten tales provides ample proof of his virtuosity for the uninitiated...

These sightings include bucolically littered locations such as the Niagara River Gorge (where many a cart has been pushed to its untimely death) and mundane settings that look suspiciously like a suburb near you. <br><br>Working in the naturalist's tradition, the photographs depict the diversity of the phenomenon and carry a surprising emotional charge; readers inevitably begin to see these carts as human, at times poignant in their abandoned, decrepit state, hilariously incapacitated, or ingeniously co-opted. The result is at once rigorous and absurd, enabling the layperson to identify and classify their own cart spottings based on the situation in which they were found.</p><p>Julian Montague is an artist and graphic designer whose various art projects address issues of scientific classification as they relate to our perceptions of the natural and man-made worlds.

An &#34;AudioFile&#34; Earphones Award winner and an Audie Award nominee, he earned a &#34;Publishers Weekly&#34; Listen-Up Award for his reading of &#34;Savages&#34; by Don Winslow.Set in a small Kentucky farming village, this collection of Berry's Port William stories illuminates the evolution of rural American life over the course of the 20th century. In 23 stories, Berry chronicles Port William from the 1880s to the 1980s, evoking the connectedness of the small town's denizens to each other and to the land. In "A Consent," a memorable auction of home-baked cakes launches a romance between farmer Tol Proudfoot and Miss Minnie Quinch, the schoolteacher who becomes his bride. Their courtship, marriage and life together form the backbone of several other stories-in "A Half Pint of Old Darling," set during Prohibition, Miss Minnie goes on a brief but garrulous bender. "Nearly to the Fair" describes how Tol and Miss Minnie "went easy into the modern world" with their first motor car, a Model A coupe in which they're never as comfortable as they are with their horses. The most touching story in the collection is "Fidelity," about a terminally ill 82-year-old farmer whose son kidnaps him from the hospital so he can die on the land he worked and loved. Though many stories move at a glacial pace, Berry's writing is graceful, poignant and compassionate, and his feel for the inner lives of his quirky rural characters makes for many memorable portraits. A valuable work of literature and historical set piece, this collection vividly captures the fabric of a kind of all-American life. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the author of The Devil Wears Prada. 300,000 first printing.</p><p>Lauren Weisberger is the author of <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, which spent more than a year on the <i>New York Times</i> hardcover and paperback bestseller lists. The film version, starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, won a Golden Globe Award and grossed over $300 million worldwide. Her second novel, <i>Everyone Worth Knowing</i>, was also a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. She lives in New York City with her husband.Chasing Harry Winston <br><br>panties is a vile word<p></p><br><br>When Leigh&#x2019;s doorbell rang unexpectedly at nine on a Monday night, she did not think, Gee, I wonder who that could be. She thought, Shit. Go away. Were there people who actually welcomed unannounced visitors when they just stopped by to &#x201c;say hello&#x201d; or &#x201c;check in&#x201d;? Recluses, probably. Or those friendly Midwestern folks she&#x2019;d seen depicted in Big Love but had never actually met&#x2014;yes, they probably didn&#x2019;t mind. But this! This was an affront. Monday nights were sacred and completely off-limits to the rest of the world, a time of No Human Contact when Leigh could veg out in sweats and watch episode after beautiful TiVo&#x2019;d episode of Project Runway. It was her only time alone all week, and after some intensive training on her part, her friends, her family, and her boyfriend, Russell, finally abided by it.<br><br>The girls had stopped asking for Monday-night plans at the end of the nineties; Russell, who in the beginning of their relationship had openly balked, now quietly contained his resentment (and in football season relished having his own Monday nights free); her mother struggled through one night a week without picking up the phone to call, finally accepting after all these years that she wouldn&#x2019;t hear from Leigh until Tuesday morning no matter how many times she hit Redial. Even Leigh&#x2019;s publisher knew better than to assign her Monday-night reading...or, god forbid, knew not to log an interrupting phone call. Which is precisely why it was so incredible that her doorbell had just rung&#x2014;incredible and panic-inducing.<br><br>Figuring it was her super, there to change the air-conditioning filter; or one of the delivery guys from Hot Enchiladas, leaving a menu; or, most likely of all, someone just confusing her door with one of her neighbors&#x2019;, she hit Mute on the TV remote and did not move a muscle. She cocked her head to the side like a Labrador, straining for any confirmation that the intruder had left, but the only thing she heard was the dull, constant thudding from above. Suffering from what her old shrink called &#x201c;noise sensitivity&#x201d; and everyone else described as &#x201c;fucking neurotic,&#x201d; Leigh had, of course, thoroughly scoped out her upstairs neighbor before signing over her life savings: The apartment might have been the most perfect she&#x2019;d seen in a year and a half of looking, but she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to take any chances.<br><br>Leigh had asked Adriana for the scoop on the woman above her, in apartment 17D, but her friend had just pursed her pouty lips and shrugged. No matter that Adriana had lived in the building&#x2019;s full-floor penthouse apartment from the day her parents had moved from S�o Paulo to New York nearly two decades before; she had completely embraced the New Yorker&#x2019;s I-Promise-Not-to-Acknowledge-You-If-You-Extend-Me-the-Same-Courtesy attitude toward her neighbors and could offer Leigh no info on her neighbor. And so, on a blustery December Saturday right before Christmas, Leigh had slipped the building&#x2019;s doorman twenty bucks, Bond-style, and waited in the lobby, pretending to read a manuscript. After Leigh spent three hours scanning the same anecdote, the doorman coughed loudly and looked at her over the top of his glasses with meaning. Glancing up, Leigh felt an immediate wave of relief. Before her, removing a QVC catalog from an unlocked mailbox, stood an overweight woman in a polka-dot housedress. Not a day younger than eighty, thought Leigh, and she breathed a sigh of relief; there would be no stilettos clacking against the hardwood floors, no late-night parties, no parade of visitors stomping around.<br><br>The very next day Leigh wrote a check for the down payment, and two months later she excitedly moved into her mint-condition one-bedroom dream apartment. It had a renovated kitchen, an oversized bathtub, and a more than decent northern view of the Empire State Building. It might have been one of the smallest units in the building&#x2014;okay, the smallest&#x2014;but it was still a dream, a beautiful, lucky dream in a building Leigh never thought she could afford, each and every obscenely priced square foot paid for with her own hard work and savings.<br><br>How could she possibly have predicted that the seemingly innocuous upstairs neighbor was a dedicated wearer of massive wooden orthopedic clogs? Still, Leigh berated herself regularly for thinking high heels were the only potential noise risk: it had been an amateur&#x2019;s mistake. Before she&#x2019;d spotted her neighbor wearing the offending shoes, Leigh had created an elaborate explanation for the relentless upstairs racket. She decided that the woman had to be Dutch (since everyone knew Dutch people wore clogs), and the matriarch of a huge, proudly Dutch family who received constant visits from countless children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, siblings, cousins, and general advice-seekers...all, most likely, Dutch clog-wearers. After spotting her neighbor wearing an air cast and feigning interest in the woman&#x2019;s disgusting-sounding foot ailments including (but not limited to) plantar fasciitis, ingrown toenails, neuromas, and bunions, Leigh had clucked as sympathetically as she could manage and then raced upstairs to check her copy of the co-op rules. Sure enough, they dictated that owners were required to cover eighty percent of their hardwood floors with carpet&#x2014;which she realized was an entirely moot point when the very next page revealed that her upstairs neighbor was president of the board.<br><br>Leigh had already endured nearly four months of round-the-clock clogging, something that might have been funny if it was happening to someone else. Her nerves were directly tied to the volume and frequency of the steady thump-thump-thump that segued into a thumpety-thump-thumpety-thump-thump pattern when Leigh&#x2019;s heart began to pound right along with it. She tried to breathe slowly, but her exhales were short and raspy, punctuated by little guppy gasps. As she examined her pale complexion (which on good days she thought of as &#x201c;ethereal&#x201d; and all other times accepted as &#x201c;sickly&#x201d;) in the mirrored hallway closet door, a thin sheen of perspiration dampened her forehead.<br><br>It seemed to be happening more frequently, this sweating/breathing issue&#x2014;and not just when she heard the wood-on-wood banging. Sometimes Leigh would awaken from a sleep so deep it almost hurt, only to find her heart racing and her sheets drenched. Last week in the middle of an otherwise completely relaxing shavasna&#x2014;albeit one where the instructor felt compelled to play an a capella version of &#x201c;Amazing Grace&#x201d; over the speakers&#x2014;a sharp pain shot through Leigh&#x2019;s chest on each measured inhale. And just this morning as she watched the human tidal wave of commuters cram onto the N train&#x2014;she forced herself to take the subway, but hated every second of it&#x2014;Leigh&#x2019;s throat constricted and her pulse inexplicably quickened. There seemed to be only two plausible explanations, and although she could be a bit of a hypochondriac, even Leigh didn&#x2019;t think she was a likely candidate for a coronary: It was a panic attack, plain and simple.<br><br>In an ineffective attempt to dispel the panic, Leigh pressed her fingertips into her temples and stretched her neck from side to side, neither of which did a damn thing. It felt like her lungs could reach only ten percent capacity, and just as she considered who would find her body&#x2014;and when&#x2014;she heard a choked sobbing and yet another ring of her doorbell.<br><br>She tiptoed over to the door and looked through the peephole but saw only empty hallway. This was exactly how people ended up robbed and raped in New York City&#x2014;getting duped by some criminal mastermind into opening their doors. I&#x2019;m not falling for this, she thought as she stealthily dialed her doorman. Never mind that her building&#x2019;s security rivaled the UN&#x2019;s, or that in eight years of city living she didn&#x2019;t personally know anyone who&#x2019;d been so much as pickpocketed, or that the chances of a psychopathic murderer choosing her apartment from more than two hundred other units in her building was unlikely.... This was how it all started.<br><br>The doorman answered after four eternally long rings.<br><br>&#x201c;Gerard, it&#x2019;s Leigh Eisner in 16D. There&#x2019;s someone outside my door. I think they&#x2019;re trying to break in. Can you come up here right away? Should I call 911?&#x201d; The words came out in a frantic jumble as Leigh paced the small foyer and popped Nicorette squares into her mouth directly from the foil wrapper.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Eisner, of course I&#x2019;ll send someone up immediately, but perhaps you&#x2019;re mistaking Miss Solomon for someone else? She arrived a few minutes ago and proceeded directly to your apartment...which is permissible for someone on your permanent clearance list.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Emmy&#x2019;s here?&#x201d; Leigh asked. She forgot all about her imminent death by disease or homicide and pulled open her door to find Emmy rocking back and forth on the hallway floor, knees pulled tight against her chest, cheeks slick with tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss, may I be of further assistance? Shall I still&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for your help, Gerard. We&#x2019;re fine now,&#x201d; Leigh said, snapping shut her cell phone and shoving it into the kangaroo pocket of her sweatshirt. She dropped to her knees without thinking and wrapped her arms around Emmy.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she crooned, gathering Emmy&#x2019;s tear-dampened hair from her face into a ponytail. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>The show of concern brought with it a fresh stream of tears; Emmy was sobbing so hard her tiny body trembled. Leigh ran through the possibilities of what could cause such pain, and came up with only three: a death in the family, a pending death in the family, or a man.<br><br>&#x201c;Sweetie, is it your parents? Did something happen to them? To Izzie?&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to me, Emmy. Is everything okay with Duncan?&#x201d;<br><br>This elicited a wail so plaintive it hurt Leigh to hear it. Bingo.<br><br>&#x201c;Over,&#x201d; Emmy cried, her voice catching in her throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over for good.&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy had made this pronouncement no fewer than eight times in the five years she and Duncan had been dating, but something about tonight seemed different.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s all just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He met someone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He what?&#x201d; Leigh dropped her arms and sat back on her ankles.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, let me rephrase: I bought him someone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Remember when I got him a membership at Clay for his thirty-first birthday because he was desperate to get back in shape? And then he never went&#x2014;not one fucking time in two whole years&#x2014;because, according to him, it wasn&#x2019;t &#x2018;an efficient use of his time&#x2019; to just go and stand on the treadmill? So rather than just cancel the whole damn thing and forget about it, I, genius extraordinaire, decide to buy him a series of sessions with a personal trainer so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to waste one precious second exercising like everyone else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I can see where this is going.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? You think he fucked her?&#x201d; Emmy laughed mirthlessly. It sometimes surprised people to hear Emmy trash-talk with such ferocity&#x2014;she was, after all, only five-one and looked no older than a teenager&#x2014;but Leigh barely even noticed anymore. &#x201c;I thought so, too. It&#x2019;s so much worse than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That sounds bad enough, sweetheart.&#x201d; All-out loving sympathy and support were the best she could offer, but Emmy didn&#x2019;t appear comforted.<br><br>&#x201c;You probably wonder how it could get worse, right? Well, let me tell you how. He didn&#x2019;t just fuck her&#x2014;I could maybe deal with that. Noooo, not my Duncan. He &#x2018;fell in love&#x2019; with her.&#x201d; Emmy jabbed out air quotes with the forefingers and middle fingers of both hands and rolled her bloodshot eyes. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s &#x2018;waiting for her,&#x2019; quote-unquote, until she&#x2019;s &#x2018;ready.&#x2019; She&#x2019;s a VIRGIN, for chrissake! I&#x2019;ve put up with five years of his cheating and lies and kinky, weird sex so he can FALL IN LOVE WITH A VIRGIN TRAINER I HIRED IN THE GYM I PAID FOR? In love! Leigh, what am I going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh, relieved that she could finally do something tangible, took Emmy&#x2019;s arm and helped her to her feet. &#x201c;Come in, honey. Let&#x2019;s go inside. I&#x2019;ll make us some tea and you can tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy sniffed. &#x201c;Oh, god, I forgot...it&#x2019;s Monday. I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt. I&#x2019;ll be fine....&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. I wasn&#x2019;t even doing anything,&#x201d; Leigh lied. &#x201c;Come in this minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh led her to the couch and, after patting the overstuffed arm to indicate where Emmy should rest her head, ducked behind the wall that separated the living room from the kitchen. With its speckled granite countertops and new stainless steel appliances, the kitchen was Leigh&#x2019;s favorite room in the whole apartment. All of her pots and pans hung from under-cabinet hooks in order of size, and all of her utensils and spices were obsessively organized in matching glass and stainless containers. Crumbs, spills, wrappers, dirty dishes&#x2014;all nonexistent. The refrigerator looked like someone had Hoovered it clean, and the countertops were entirely smudge-free. If it was possible for a room to personify its owner&#x2019;s neurotic personality, the kitchen and Leigh could be identical twins.<br><br>She filled the kettle (purchased just last week during a Bloomingdale&#x2019;s Home Sale, because who said you were entitled to new things only when you registered?), piled a tray high with cheese and Wheat Thins, and peeked through the window into the living room to make sure Emmy was resting comfortably. Seeing that she was lying flat on her back with an arm flung over her eyes, Leigh slipped out her cell phone and selected Adriana&#x2019;s name from her phone book. She typed: SOS. E &amp; D finished. Get down here ASAP.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have Advil?&#x201d; Emmy called from the couch. And then, more quietly: &#x201c;Duncan always carried Advil.&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh opened her mouth to add that Duncan had always carried a lot of things&#x2014;a business card for his favorite escort service, a wallet-sized picture of himself as a child, and, occasionally, a genital wart or two that he swore were just &#x201c;skin tags&#x201d;&#x2014;but she controlled herself. In addition to being unnecessary since Emmy was suffering enough, it would be hypocritical: Contrary to everyone&#x2019;s belief, Leigh wasn&#x2019;t exactly in the world&#x2019;s most perfect relationship, either. But she pushed the thought of Russell from her mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, I&#x2019;ll get you some in a minute,&#x201d; she said, turning off the whistling kettle. &#x201c;Tea&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br><br>The girls had just taken their first sips when the doorbell rang. Emmy looked at Leigh, who just said, &#x201c;Adriana.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s open!&#x201d; Leigh called toward the front door, but Adriana had already figured that out. She stormed into the living room and stood with her hands on her hips, surveying the scene.<br><br>&#x201c;What is going on here?&#x201d; she demanded. Adriana&#x2019;s slight Brazilian accent, little more than a soft, sexy lilting when she was calm, made her almost unintelligible when she felt, in her own words, &#x201c;passionate&#x201d; about someone or something. Which was pretty much always. &#x201c;Where are the drinks?&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh motioned to the kitchen. &#x201c;Water&#x2019;s still hot. Check the cupboard above the microwave. I have a whole bunch of different flavors in&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No tea!&#x201d; Adriana screeched and pointed to Emmy. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see she&#x2019;s miserable? We need real drinks. I&#x2019;ll make caipirinhas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any mint. Or limes. Actually, I&#x2019;m not even sure I have the right booze,&#x201d; Leigh said.<br><br>&#x201c;I brought everything.&#x201d; Adriana lifted a large paper bag over her head and grinned.<br><br>Leigh often found Adriana&#x2019;s abruptness irritating, sometimes a little overwhelming, but tonight she was grateful to her for taking control of the situation. It had been nearly twelve years since Leigh first saw Adriana&#x2019;s smile, and still it left her feeling awestruck and a little anxious.

Many of these Scots-Irish immigrants made their way into the mountains of the southern Appalachian region. They brought with them a wealth of traditional ballads and tunes from the British Isles and Ireland, a carrying stream that merged with sounds and songs of English, German, Welsh, African American, French, and Cherokee origin. Their enduring legacy of music flows today from Appalachia back to Ireland and Scotland and around the globe. In <i>Wayfaring Strangers</i>, Fiona Ritchie and Doug Orr guide readers on a musical voyage across oceans, linking people and songs through centuries of adaptation and change. <br><br>From ancient ballads at the heart of the tradition to instruments that express this dynamic music, Ritchie and Orr chronicle the details of an epic journey. Enriched by the insights of key contributors to the living tradition on both sides of the Atlantic, this abundantly illustrated volume includes a CD featuring 20 songs by musicians profiled in the book, including Dolly Parton, Dougie MacLean, Cara Dillon, John Doyle, Pete Seeger, Sheila Kay Adams, Jean Ritchie, Doc Watson, David Holt, Anais Mitchell, Al Petteway, and Amy White.<br><br>In 2017, noted Scottish musician Phil Cunningham followed this musical migration for the acclaimed BBC tv series "Wayfaring Stranger" to which the authors contributed. &nbsp;In the pages of this book, tv viewers will enjoy re-visiting the people and places they loved on screen.<br><br></p><p>Fiona Ritchie is the founder, producer, and host of National Public Radio's <i>The Thistle &amp; Shamrock</i>�.

Doug Orr is president emeritus of Warren Wilson College, where he founded the Swannanoa Gathering music workshops.The story of the Scots-Irish 'carrying stream' of music that found its way to Appalachia is also the story of the Cash family. William Cash emigrated from Scotland in the mid-seventeenth century, and the next generation drifted down to Virginia. The songs that went with them were captured, in part, a couple of centuries later by my stepmother's family, the Carter Family. My own musical DNA is bound with these songs--the narrative ballads, the melancholy rhymes, the ancient stories retold in melody again and again. Except for my family, there is nothing I love more than being a part of the 'living tradition' captured in this book.--Rosanne Cash, singer-songwriter and author<br>Who better to write this book than Fiona Ritchie and Doug Orr? They have each spent a lifetime intensely interested in the same thread of music from opposite sides of the ocean. The music connected them with each other, I suspect, long before they ever met, just as it connects all of us across miles and time, through generations and immigrations, anchoring us to the story of our ancestors and, ultimately, ourselves. These two are the perfect authors to trace the journey this music has made and to paint the picture of the living, breathing stream that it is.--Kathy Mattea, singer-songwriter and teacher<br>Songs can take us on extraordinary journeys. They respect neither border nor time, and by following them, we can chart the movement of generations of people.

It's a fascinating and often surprising ride.--Cerys Matthews, Welsh folksinger, author, and broadcaster<br>History's a strange beast. In the absence of illumination by the lives of real men and women, it can on occasion be reduced to the prosaic. When that happens, often the gaps are filled with kitsch, with a sentimental mire of misunderstanding that does more harm than good. This book isn't like that. It's full of hard fact that's been turned into the best kind of history by even harder poetry and honest melody. Nothing more is needed. To tie several centuries of peoples' lives together, across oceans and mountains, to make sense of their experiences and aspirations by the tenacious strands of their own music and song--that is a real achievement.--Brian McNeill, Scottish singer-songwriter, producer, and novelist<br>Exploring the historic ties between Scotland, Ireland, and Appalachia through music, Fiona Ritchie and Doug Orr weave together the story of migration through the lyrics of ballads and other music that reflects on this history. <i>Wayfaring Strangers</i> will touch a powerful chord in the lives of readers who appreciate the music of Scotland and Appalachia, as well as those whose families have ties to this rich historical journey.--William Ferris, author of <i>The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists</i><br>In telling the story of the Scottish diaspora in Appalachia through music, Fiona Ritchie and Doug Orr have captured a process of adaptation and change that has created a traditional culture that continues to flourish.--Ron Pen, author of <i>I Wonder as I Wander: The Life of John Jacob Niles</i><br><br></p><h2>From Here to Forever</h2><p>Used - Paperback/Worcceptable A view of previous History of our World; the chaos and confusion, and God&#39;s ultimate plan for mankind.</p><p></p><h2>Before Dishonor (Star Trek: The Next Generation)</h2><p>An enemy so intractable that it cannot be reasoned with.

Twice Starfleet assembled and threw countless starships to stand against them. The Borg were stopped, the price paid in blood. Humanity breathed a sigh of relief, assuming it was safe.

In Ohio, where Confederate victory was once almost certain, Featherstone&#x2019;s army is crumbling, and reinforcements of uninspired Mexican troops cannot stanch a Northern assault on the heartland. <br><br>The tide of war is changing, and victory seems within the grasp of the USA. Still, new fighting flares from Denver to Los Angeles.<br><br>Indeed, as the air, ground, and water burn with molten fury, new and demonic tools of killing are unleashed, and secret wars are unfolding. The U.S. government in Philadelphia has proof that the tyrannical Featherstone is murdering African Americans by the tens of thousands in a Texas gulag called Determination. And the leaders of both sides know full well that the world&#x2019;s next great power will not be the one with the biggest army but the nation that wins the race against nature and science&#x2013;and smashes open the power of the atom.<br><br>In Settling Accounts, Harry Turtledove blends vivid fictional characters with a cast inspired by history, including the Socialist assistant secretary of war Franklin Delano Roosevelt and beleaguered Confederate military commander Nathan Bedford Forrest. In The Grapple, he takes his spellbinding vision to new heights as he captures the heart and soul of a generation born and raised amid unimaginable violence.

He is married to fellow novelist Laura Frankos. They have three daughters: Alison, Rachel, and Rebecca.I<br><br> Funereal music poured out of the wireless set on Brigadier General Clarence Potter&#x2019;s desk. For three days, Confederate stations had played nothing but somber tunes and even more somber commentaries praising the courage of the army whose survivors had just surrendered in Pittsburgh.<br><br> Potter&#x2019;s mouth twisted. Behind steel-rimmed spectacles, his cold gray eyes flashed. That army should have taken Pittsburgh away from the damnyankees. With their great industrial center gone, the USA should have had to make peace. From everything the Intelligence officer knew, Pittsburgh was a wreck. That would hurt the United States. But the army that should have conquered it was gone, every man a casualty or a prisoner. That would hurt the Confederate States even more.<br><br> The latest dirge-tempo march ended. An announcer came on the air. &#x201c;Courage, self-denial, modesty, and the willingness to make every sacrifice are the highest virtues of the Confederate soldier,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was not the lust for conquest which caused the Confederacy to take up arms. This war was forced upon us by the destructive aims of our enemies.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, what else could the man say? If he came right out and announced that Jake Featherston wanted to go to war long before he became President of the CSA, it wouldn&#x2019;t look good. Potter knew perfectly well that it was true. He also knew that what was true and what made good propaganda often had not even a nodding acquaintance with each other.<br><br> &#x201c;Our soldiers are completely imbued with the importance and the value of the ideas now championed by the Freedom Party,&#x201d; the announcer said. For better and for worse, Potter knew how true that was. The announcer went on, &#x201c;The Confederate soldier is convinced of them to the very depths of his innermost being, and that is why the Confederate armed forces form an invincible bloc having as its spiritual foundation the sublime ethics of a soldierly tradition. It is, moreover, inspired by belief in its high mission of protecting the Confederate States against the longtime enemy to the north, the enemy who would gladly deny our great nation its very right to exist.&#x201d;<br><br> Again, he wasn&#x2019;t wrong. This was the fourth war between the USA and the CSA in the past eighty years. But if the Confederates were so bloody invincible, what went wrong in Pennsylvania? Potter, a confirmed cynic, would think of something like that. Would the average Confederate who was listening? Maybe not.<br><br> &#x201c;We see the most magnificent example of this in the sacrifice of the troops fighting at Pittsburgh,&#x201d; the announcer went on. &#x201c;That let our armies farther west build up new dams to hold back the raging Yankee torrent and continue to preserve the Confederacy from the annihilating rule of the USA. Cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements, surrounded by implacable foes, they fought on with bayonets and entrenching tools after their ammunition was exhausted. Truly their courage and devotion will live forever.&#x201d;<br><br> The music swelled once more: yet another sorrowful tune. Potter sighed. Putting a good face on disaster was always hard. He wondered why he kept listening. Knowing what the rest of the country was going through was useful. That had something to do with it. The rest was akin to picking at a scab. The pain held a perverse attraction.<br><br> He started a little when the telephone rang. Turning down the music, he picked up the handset. &#x201c;Potter here.&#x201d; If anybody needed to know what he did, that person had got hold of him by mistake.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Potter there.&#x201d; The voice on the other end of the line was a harsh rasp every Confederate citizen recognized at once. &#x201c;I need you to be Potter here, soon as you can get on over.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Mr. President. On my way.&#x201d; Potter hung up. He turned off the wireless. When Jake Featherston said he wanted to see you as soon as you could come, you needed to get to the Gray House in a hurry.<br><br> Potter went upstairs. The door by which he came out on the ground floor had something innocuous painted on the frosted-glass window. You would never open it unless you already knew where it led.<br><br> Workmen labored to repair bomb damage. The damnyankees hit the War Department as often as they could. More and more of the business here went on underground&#x2014;how far underground, even Potter wasn&#x2019;t sure any more. The men who bossed the work parties were whites too old or too crippled to help the war effort. Some of the men in the crews were colored, though a lot of Negroes had already been removed from Richmond. More workmen were Mexicans, up from Francisco Jos�&#x2019;s ramshackle empire to find better-paying work in the CSA.<br><br> Some offices on the ground floor were still usable. The officers and clerks who worked in them took a sour pride in staying at those battered desks as long as they could. Several men waved to Potter as he walked past. He nodded in return.<br><br> All the motorcars outside the War Department were ordinary civilian models. Every so often, U.S. fighters streaked low over Richmond in broad daylight, shooting up whatever they could. No point giving them any special targets. As if at a cab stand, Potter got into the forwardmost auto. &#x201c;The Gray House,&#x201d; he told the driver.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The soldier started the engine and put the Birmingham in gear.<br><br> More work crews repaired streets and gas lines and water mains and electric lines and telephone wires and . . . anything else that could be damaged when bombs fell on it or near it. Hardly any glass windows faced the world these days. Plywood and cardboard covered even the ones the damnyankees hadn&#x2019;t blown to smithereens.<br><br> Again, Mexicans did a lot of the work Negroes would have handled before. The Confederate States would be a different country when the war was through. Whites had anxiously watched blacks for much too long. Well, soon there&#x2019;d be far fewer blacks to need watching. Potter had long opposed the Freedom Party, but he didn&#x2019;t mind its taking a shot at the Negro problem. He didn&#x2019;t know any white man who did.<br><br> As he&#x2019;d expected, the driver had to detour several times before he got to the presidential mansion. Craters made some streets impassable. One block had sawhorses and warning signs all around. danger! unexploded bomb! the signs shouted in big red letters. Maybe the bomb was a dud. Maybe a time fuse ticked inside it. Either way, Potter didn&#x2019;t envy the men who worked to get the ordnance out of there. They were skilled technicians. No matter how skilled they were, their average life expectancy was measured in weeks.<br><br> The snouts of sandbagged antiaircraft guns poked up from the Gray House grounds. Not much of the building was left above ground. The damnyankees kept doing their best to level it. They wanted Jake Featherston dead, not only because losing him would take the wind out of the Confederacy&#x2019;s sails, but also because Confederate bombs had killed U.S. President Al Smith.<br><br> &#x201c;Here you are, sir.&#x201d; The driver pulled to a stop in front of the rubble pile.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Clarence Potter got out of the Birmingham. With a clash of gears, it rolled away.<br><br> Guards waited in among the wreckage. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see your papers, sir,&#x201d; one of them said.<br><br> No one got anywhere in the CSA without proper papers these days. Potter displayed his. Once the guards were satisfied about who he was, one of them used a telephone. That done, he nodded to his pal. Together, they opened a heavy steel trap door.<br><br> Potter went down the stairs. They bent several times to foil blast that might penetrate the door above. In due course, he got to another door, this one even thicker. He pressed the button next to it. It swung open from the inside. More guards nodded to him. &#x201c;Come with us, sir,&#x201d; one of them said.<br><br> &#x201c;I know the drill,&#x201d; Potter said.<br><br> They ignored him. He&#x2019;d figured they would. All of what went on at the Gray House went on underground these days. People who spent a lot of time down there were as pale and pasty as . . . people who spent a lot of time underground at the War Department. Potter looked at the backs of his own hands, and at the veins clearly visible there. He wasn&#x2019;t a vampire, to whom the sun was death, but he often behaved as if he were.<br><br> Lulu, Jake Featherston&#x2019;s longtime secretary, nodded to him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be with you in a moment, General,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Potter answered. You treated Lulu with respect or you were sorry. No one ever talked about the authority secretaries and other such people had, which didn&#x2019;t make it any less real.<br><br> The moment stretched to about five minutes. Featherston wasn&#x2019;t in the habit of making people cool their heels just to be sitting. Something had to be going on. And something was. Nathan Bedford Forrest III, the head of the Confederate General Staff, came out of the President&#x2019;s office. He didn&#x2019;t look happy.<br><br> He looked even less happy when he saw Potter in the waiting room. Potter wasn&#x2019;t happy to see him, either. They weren&#x2019;t quite conspirators. If it looked as if Jake Featherston was dragging the CSA down to ruin, someone would have to try to dispose of him. If that worked, someone would have to try to run the country afterwards. As far as Potter could see, Nathan Bedford Forrest III made far and away the best candidate.<br><br> Forrest wanted the job as much as he wanted another head. That didn&#x2019;t mean he wouldn&#x2019;t try to do it&#x2014;he had a strong sense of duty. It meant he hoped everything would turn out all right, even though he was the one who&#x2019;d first...</p><h2>Conceiving God: The Cognitive Origin and Evolution of Religion</h2><p><p><strong>A controversial exploration of the origin of religion in the neurology of the human brain.</strong></p> In this book the noted cognitive archaeologist David Lewis-Williams confronts a question that troubles many people in the world today: Is there a supernatural realm that intervenes in the material world of daily life and leads to the evolution of religions?<br><br> Professor Lewis-Williams first describes how science developed within the cocoon of religion and then shows how the natural functioning of the human brain creates experiences that can lead to belief in a supernatural realm, beings, and interventions. Once people have these experiences, they formulate beliefs about<br> them, and thus creeds are born.<br><br> Forty thousand years ago, people were leaving traces in the archaeological record of activities that we can label religious, and Lewis-Williams discusses in detail the evidence preserved in the Volp Caves in France.

For the Victorians, therefore, when anaesthesia was first practised, it was commonly seen as traumatic&#x2014;for doctors were being asked to induce a condition looked upon as partial death. Viewed with suspicion, many feared that they would never wake again, or that they would lose their faculties on a permanent basis, even become insane. Yet, especially after Queen Victoria allowed its administration to her during childbirth, its use to block out pain became widespread. This engaging and entertaining book traces the social, medical and criminal history of chloroform, from early medical practices to create oblivion through the discovery of chloroform and its discovery, its use and misuse in the 19th century, to the present. Today chloroform is no longer used as an anaesthetic, but has a multitude of uses in industry and medical research, including a role in DNA profiling. A by-product of the chlorination of water, we inhale infinitesimal amounts of chloroform every time we have a shower.</p><p>Linda Stratmann was born in 1948. When she was 16 she took a part-time job in Boots the Chemist and well remembers selling and dispensing Collis Browne&#39;s Chlorodyne. She currently works as a tax inspector. She also edits on a freelance basis. She has had a long-term interest in true crime and has done extensive research in this field. This is her first book.</p><h2>Spy Ski School (Exclusive Edition) (Spy School Series #4)</h2><p>Limited collector&#39;s edition of Spy Ski School, the fourth book in Stuart Gibbs&#39;s Spy School series, featuring an exclusive jacket with shiny silver foil and a full-color map of the Lionshead ski village on the reverse side-plus 16 pages of bonus content, including super-secret spy reports and post-operational interviews. Ben Ripley enrolls in ski school, where the slopes, and the stakes, get really steep in this follow-up to the Edgar Award-nominated Spy School, Spy Camp, and Evil Spy School. Twelve-year-old Ben Ripley is not exactly the best student spy school has ever seen-he keeps flunking Advanced Self Preservation. But outside of class, Ben is pretty great at staying alive. His enemies have kidnapped him, shot at him, locked him in a room with a ticking time bomb, and even tried to blow him up with missiles. And he&#39;s survived every time. After all that unexpected success, the CIA has decided to activate Ben for real. The Mission: Become friends with Jessica Shang, the daughter of a suspected Chinese crime boss, and find out all of her father&#39;s secrets. Jessica wants to go to ski school in the Rocky Mountains, so a select few spy school students are going skiing too-under cover, of course. Ben might not be able to handle a weapon (or a pair of skis), but he can make friends easy peasy. That is, until his best friend from home drops in on the trip and jeopardizes the entire mission..</p><p></p><h2>Oscar: A Life</h2><p><p></p><p><b>'The Book of the Year, perhaps of the decade, has to be Matthew Sturgis's <i>Oscar</i>' <i>TLS</i>, Books of the Year. </b></p><p></p><p>A <i>SUNDAY TIMES</i> BOOK OF THE YEAR. </p><p><b>'Simply the best modern biography of Wilde ...

He was both an early exponent and a victim of 'celebrity culture': famous for being famous, he was lauded and ridiculed in equal measure. His achievements were frequently downplayed, his successes resented. He had a genius for comedy but strove to write tragedies. He was an unabashed snob who nevertheless delighted in exposing the faults of society. He affected a dandified disdain but was prone to great acts of kindness. Although happily married, he became a passionate lover of men and &#x2013; at the very peak of his success &#x2013; brought disaster upon himself. He disparaged authority, yet went to the law to defend his love for Lord Alfred Douglas. Having delighted in fashionable throngs, Wilde died almost alone: barely a dozen people were at his graveside. </p><p>Yet despite this ruinous end, Wilde's star continues to shine brightly. His was a life of quite extraordinary drama. Above all, his flamboyant refusal to conform to the social and sexual orthodoxies of his day make him a hero and an inspiration to all who seek to challenge convention. </p><p>In the first major biography of Oscar Wilde in thirty years, Matthew Sturgis draws on a wealth of new material and fresh research to place the man firmly in the context of his times. He brings alive the distinctive mood and characters of the <i>fin de si�cle</i> in the richest and most compelling portrait of Wilde to date. </p></p><p></p><h2>Green Eggs and Ham Cookbook: Recipes Inspired by Dr. Seuss</h2><p>Ever wonder what green eggs and ham really taste like? They're yummy. And now everyone can whip up a batch for themselves using this fabulous cookbook. Filled with simple, scrumptious, wacky recipes for such foods as Cat in the Hat Pudding and Moose Juice and Schlopp, this unique cookbook will have the whole family hamming it up in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each recipe is accompanied by the original verse that inspired it, and the pages are laminated to protect against getting splatters of Sneetch Salad, Oobleck, and Solla Sollew Stew.</p><p>Georgeanne Brennan is an award-winning cookbook author and journalist. Her expertise in all things related to food and gastronomy ranges from farming and agriculture to history and food lore. Her cookbook, <i>Aperitif: Recipes for Simple Pleasures in the French Style</i>, won the Julia Child Cookbook Award in 1998. Ms. Brennan was educated at San Diego State University, the University of California and the University of Aix-Marseille in Provence, France, the village that would be the inspiration for her memoir-cookbook, <i>The Food and the Flavors of Haute Provence</i>, winner of the 1998 James Beard Cookbook Award. Ms. Brennan currently resides with her husband on a small farm in Northern California near Davis. They have four children. The author lives in Northern California.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;This cookbook goes far beyond what one might expect. Many children have probably made green eggs and ham using copious amounts of green food coloring, but here, the ham is green thanks to a coating made from cilantro and tomatillos, and the eggs' usually yellow yolks are covered by a mound of guacamole. Many other recipes are equally creative; the Pink Yink Ink Drink is yummy, healthy, and sure to be a hit. While some of the connections to the Dr. Seuss books are a bit of a stretch, all include quotes that clarify their ties to specific stories. As with many cookbooks that are written to fit a predetermined theme, there is a wide range in both the difficulty and complexity of the recipes. Adult assistance will be needed for many of them, and several will send parents to the store for ingredients (shallots, rock shrimp, clams). However, the dishes' playful names and inventive presentations will have children trying new foods and adults enjoying the flavorful combinations. A great addition to the world of book-themed cookbooks.&#x2014;<i>Genevieve Gallagher, Murray Elementary School, Charlottesville, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

British actress Eleanor Bron does it full justice as she tells the story of a widow with two grown children who has married a pompous bore. But he is also decent and reliable. Or is he? Here the narrator has interpreted his true nature, not by any revelatory dramatic performance, but by a subtle reading of the double-edged dialogue throughout. With such convincing narration, who cares if the book itself ever comes back in print? J.C. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Decorative Art 1970s</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>These two volumes reprint edited versions (from the Sixties and Seventies) of Decorative Art in Modern Interiors, which was originally published as the yearbook of the British journal Studio Magazine. As the editors point out, since its founding in 1893, the magazine was one of the first publications to promote good design by showcasing practitioners such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Charles Voysey. It continued its mission of presenting the latest in international design until the 1980s, when it folded. The two books are divided into chapters that cover the best of architecture, interior design, furniture, textiles, wallpaper, glassware, lighting, silver, and ceramics. They are illustrated with hundreds of photographs, and in some cases floor plans and elevations for buildings are included as well. While little or no information is given regarding the designers, architects, or firms responsible for the work, and indexing is not as comprehensive as it could be, for those looking for examples of how we lived in the "Swinging Sixties" (shag carpeting and all) and subsequent design trends of the 1970s, this is the place to look.

She hung the red dress on the wardrobe door, glancing at it from time to time as she brushed her hair. That neckline seemed to be getting lower by the minute. In the end her nerve failed her. She hunted out her pink dress, the one she used to wear for dancing classes at school, put it on, and stood in front of the cheval mirror. She turned her head from side to side, her hands smoothing down the creases that had gathered round the waist. Oh dear. No, no, she couldn&#x2019;t do it, not this time, not ever again. She wriggled out of it and threw it to the back of the wardrobe. Out of the window would have been more satisfying, but her father and brother-in-law were sitting on the terrace. She pulled the red dress over her head, tugged the neckline up as far as it would go, and went reluctantly downstairs.<br><br>Father met her in the hall and hugged her as if he hadn&#x2019;t seen her for a year. Outside the living room, she hesitated, but there was no point wearing a red dress and then creeping along the skirting boards like a mouse, so she flung the door open and swept in. She kissed Rachel, waved at Rachel&#x2019;s husband, Tim, who was at the far side of the room talking to her mother, and then looked around for Toby, but he wasn&#x2019;t there. Perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t coming after all, though he&#x2019;d said he would. The prospect of his absence darkened the whole evening; she wasn&#x2019;t sure she could face it on her own. But then, a few minutes later, he came in, apologizing profusely, damp hair sticking to his forehead. He must&#x2019;ve been for a swim. She wished she&#x2019;d known; she&#x2019;d have gone with him. Not much hope of talking to him now; Mother had already beckoned him to her side.<br><br>Rachel was asking Elinor question after question about her life in London, who she met, who she went out with, did she have any particular friends? Elinor said as little as possible, looking for an excuse to get away. It was supplied by her mother, who appeared at her side and hissed, &#x201c;Elinor, go upstairs at once and take that ridiculous dress off.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment the gong sounded. Elinor spread her hands, all injured innocence, though underneath she felt hurt and humiliated. Yet again, she was being treated like a child.<br><br>Father came in at the last minute just as they were sitting down. She wondered at the curious mixture of poking and prying and secrecy that ruled their lives. Mother and Father saw very little of each other. She needed country air for the sake of her health; he lived at his club because it was such a convenient walking distance from the hospital, where he often had to be available late at night. Was that the reason for their weeklong separation? She doubted it. Once, crossing Tottenham Court Road, she&#x2019;d seen her father with a young woman, younger even than Rachel. They&#x2019;d just come out of a restaurant. The girl had stood, holding her wrap tightly round her thin shoulders, while Father flagged down a cab and helped her into it, and then they were whirled away into the stream of traffic. Elinor had stood and watched, open-mouthed. Father hadn&#x2019;t seen her; she was sure of that. She&#x2019;d never mentioned that incident to anyone, not even to Toby, though she and Toby were the only members of the family who kept no secrets from each other.<br><br>She sat in virtual silence for the first half of the meal&#x2014;sulking, her mother would have said&#x2014;though Tim did his clumsy best to tease her out of it. Did she have a young man yet? Was all this moodiness because she was in love?<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time for anything like that,&#x201d; Elinor said, crisply. &#x201c;They work us too hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you know what they say, don&#x2019;t you? All work and no play . . . ?&#x201d; He turned to Toby. &#x201c;Have you seen her with anybody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet, but I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s only a matter of time.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby&#x2019;s joining in the teasing, however reluctantly, was all it took to chafe Elinor&#x2019;s irritation into fury.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you must know I have met somebody.&#x201d; She plucked a name from the air. &#x201c;Kit Neville.&#x201d;<br><br>This was not true: she&#x2019;d hardly spoken to Kit Neville. He was merely the loudest, the most self-confident, the most opinionated, and, in many ways, the most obnoxious male student in her year, and therefore the person she thought of first.<br><br>&#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d; Mother asked. Predictably.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a student.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of student?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Art. What else would he be doing at the Slade?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you met his family?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now why on earth would I want to do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s what people do when&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re about to get engaged? Well, I&#x2019;m not. We&#x2019;re just friends. Very good friends, but . . . friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need to be careful, Elinor,&#x201d; Rachel said. &#x201c;Living in London on your own. You don&#x2019;t want to get a reputation . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do want to get a reputation, as it happens. I want to get a reputation as a painter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Elinor,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br><br>So even Father was turning against her. The last mouthful of cheese and biscuit sticking in her dry throat, Elinor followed her mother and Rachel out of the dining room. They sat over a pot of coffee that nobody wanted, staring at their reflections in the black windows that overlooked the airless terrace. The windows couldn&#x2019;t be opened because of moths. Rachel had a horror of moths.<br><br>&#x201c;So who is this Mr. Neville?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody, he&#x2019;s in my year, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said classes weren&#x2019;t mixed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some are, some aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She could barely speak for exasperation; she&#x2019;d brought this on herself. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s not as if we&#x2019;re going out . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So why mention him?&#x201d; Rachel&#x2019;s voice was slurry with tiredness. Tendrils of damp hair stuck to her forehead; she&#x2019;d eaten scarcely anything. She yawned and stretched her ankles out in front of her. &#x201c;Look at them. Puddings.&#x201d; She dug her fingers into the swollen flesh as if she hated it.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be worn out in this heat,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you put your feet up?&#x201d;<br><br>Feet up in the drawing room? Unheard of. But then Elinor intercepted a glance between the two women, and understood. She wondered when she was going to be told. What a family they were for not speaking. She wanted to jump on the table and shout out every miserable little secret they possessed, though, apart from the breakdown of her parents&#x2019; marriage, she couldn&#x2019;t have said what the secrets were. But there was something: a shadow underneath the water. Swim too close and you&#x2019;d cut your feet. A childhood memory surfaced. On holiday somewhere, she&#x2019;d cut her foot on a submerged rock; she&#x2019;d felt no pain, only the shock of seeing her blood smoking into the water. Toby had taken off his shirt and wrapped it round her foot, then helped her back to the promenade. She remembered his pink fingers, wrinkled from the sea, the whorl of hair on the top of his head as he bent down to examine the cut.<br><br>Why couldn&#x2019;t they leave her alone? All this nonsense about young men . . . It was just another way of drilling it into you that the real business of a girl&#x2019;s life was to find a husband. Painting was, at best, an accomplishment; at worst, a waste of time. She was trying to hold on to her anger, but she&#x2019;d suppressed it so long it was threatening to dissipate into depression. As it so often did. Why hadn&#x2019;t Toby spoken up for her? Instead of just sitting there, fiddling with his knife and fork.<br><br>She was thoroughly fed up. As soon as possible after the men joined them, she excused herself, saying she needed an early night.<br><br>As she closed the door behind her, she heard Father ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you know,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Girls.&#x201d;<br><br>Meaning? Nothing that made her feel better about herself, or them.<br>Next morning after breakfast Toby announced that he was going to walk to the old mill.<br><br>&#x201c;In this heat?&#x201d; Mother said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too bad. Anyway, it&#x2019;ll be cooler by the river.&#x201d;<br><br>Elinor followed him into the hall. &#x201c;Do you mind if I come?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Toby, I walk all over London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Rachel hear you say that. Rep-u-tation!&#x201d;<br><br>They arranged to meet on the terrace. Soon Elinor was following her brother across the meadow, feeling the silken caress of long grasses against her bare arms and the occasional cool shock of cuckoo spit.<br><br>&#x201c;You know this chap you were talking about last night . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t you start.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was only asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I only mentioned him because I&#x2019;m sick of being teased. I just wanted to get Tim off my back. Instead of which, I got Mother onto it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Rachel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s worse than Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s jealous, that&#x2019;s all. She settled down a bit too early and . . . Well, she didn&#x2019;t exactly get a bargain, did she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like Tim, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s harmless. I just don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s very happy.&#x201d; He turned to face her. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t make that mistake, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marrying Tim? Shouldn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No-o. Settling down too early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend to &#x2018;settle down&#x2019; at all.&#x201d;<br><br>She hoped that was the end of the subject, but a minute later Toby said, &#x201c;All the same, there has to be a reason you mentioned him&#x2014;I mean, him, rather than somebody else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfectly obnoxious, that&#x2019;s why. He was just the first person who came to mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Once they reached the river path, there was some shade at last, though the flashing of sunlight through the leaves and branches was oddly disorientating, and more than once she tripped over a root or jarred herself stepping on air.<br><br>&#x201c;Be easier coming back,&#x201d; Toby said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t have the sun in our eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t want to go on talking. She was content to let images rise and fall in her mind: her lodgings in London, the Antiques Room at the Slade, the friends she was starting to make, the first few spindly shoots of independence, though it all seemed a little unreal here, in this thick heat, with dusty leaves grazing the side of her face and swarms of insects making a constant humming in the green shade.<br><br>She was walking along, hardly aware of her surroundings, when a sudden fierce buzzing broke into her trance. Toby caught her arm. Bluebottles, gleaming sapphire and emerald, were glued to a heap of droppings in the center of the path. A few stragglers zoomed drunkenly towards her, fastening on her eyes and lips. She spat, batting them away.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, this way,&#x201d; Toby said. He was holding a branch for her so she could edge past the seething mass.<br><br>&#x201c;Fox?&#x201d; she asked, meaning the droppings.<br><br>&#x201c;Badger, I think. There&#x2019;s a sett up there.&#x201d;<br><br>She peered through the trees, but couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember we had a den here once?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>She remembered the den: a small, dark, smelly place under some rhododendron bushes. Tiny black insects crawled over your skin and fell into your hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it was here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was. You could just hear the weir.&#x201d;<br><br>She listened, and sure enough, between the trees, barely audible, came the sound of rushing water.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I remember now. I thought it was a bit farther on.&#x201d;<br><br>She thought he might want to go there, he lingered so long, but then he turned and walked on.<br><br>The river was flowing faster now, picking up leaves and twigs and tiny, struggling insects and whirling them away, and the trees were beginning to thin out. More and more light reached the path until, at last, they came out into an open field that sloped gently down towards the weir. A disused mill&#x2014;the target of their walk&#x2014;stood at the water&#x2019;s edge, though it was many years since its wheel had turned.<br><br>This had been the forbidden place of their childhood. They were not to go in there, Mother would say. The floorboards were rotten, the ceilings liable to collapse at any minute . . .<br><br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t go near the water,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d call after them, in a last desperate attempt to keep them safe, as they walked away from her down the drive. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d chorus. &#x201c;Promise,&#x201d; Toby would add, for good measure, and then they would glance sideways at each other, red-faced from trying not to giggle.<br><br>Now, Elinor thought, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t bother going in, but Toby went straight to the side window, prised the boards apart, and hoisted himself over the sill. After a second&#x2019;s hesitation Elinor followed.<br><br>Blindness, after the blaze of sunlight. Then, gradually, things became clear: old beams, cobwebs, tracks of children&#x2019;s footprints on the dusty floor. Their own footprints? No, of course not, couldn&#x2019;t be, not after all these years. Other children came here now. She put her foot next to one of the prints, marveling at the difference in size. Toby, meanwhile, was expressing amazement at having to duck to avoid the beams.<br><br>Because this place had been the scene of so many forbidden adventures, an air of excitement still clung to it, in spite of the dingy surroundings. She went across to the window and peered out through a hole in the wall. &#x201c;I wonder what it was like to work here.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby came across and stood beside her. &#x201c;Pretty good hell, I should think. Noise and dust.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right, of course; when the wheel turned the whole place must have shook. She turned to him. &#x201c;What do you think&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br><br>He grabbed her arms and pulled her towards him. Crushed against his chest, hardly able to breathe, she laughed and struggled, taking this for the start of some childish game, but then his lips fastened onto hers with a groping hunger that shocked her into stillness. His tongue thrust between her lips, a strong, muscular presence. She felt his chin rough against her cheek, the breadth of his chest and shoulders, not that round, androgynous, childish softness that had sometimes made them seem like two halves of a single person. She started to struggle again, really struggle, but his hand came up and cupped her breast and she felt herself softening, flowing towards him, as if something hard and impacted in the pit of her stomach had begun to melt.<br><br>And then, abruptly, he pushed her away.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m sorry. Sorry, sorry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t speak. How was it possible that anybody, in a single moment, could stumble into a chasm so deep there was no getting out of it?<br><br>&#x201c;Look, you go back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home later.&#x201d;<br><br>Automatically, she turned to go, but then remembered the river and turned back.<br><br>&#x201c;No, go on, I&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wonder what&#x2019;s happened if I show up on my own.&#x201d;</p><h2>Paper Dreams: Writers and Editors on the American Literary Magazine</h2><p><p>When it comes to shaping the history behind modern American literature, few institutions have played as essential a role as that of the literary magazine.

Paper Dreams</i> is his first book.Literary magazines may have been dubbed little magazines from the start, but there is nothing small about the ambition and scope of this eclectic volume of essays by scholars, writers, and editors that spans 150 years. After a brief introduction, the book jumps into a meaty section on the rise of modernism and the magazines that fueled the movement by introducing writers such as Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and James Joyce. Readers of contemporary literary magazines will be intrigued by the history that includes the famous (the rise of Poetry, Story) and the forgotten (such as those described in Abby Ann Arthur Johnson&#39;s essay on lost African-American voices). The volume then looks at magazines in the post-war period and considers their future today. The section Writers on Literary Magazines proves the most appealing and accessible, speaking directly to the impact of these publications on authors&#39; hopes and dreams. Emergent themes include the role of money; the intrepid spirit of the magazines; the role of women; and, the impact of the Internet. Though the sheer amount of material can be daunting, the book is both a history and a how to that illuminates the influence, delights, problems, and engaging idiosyncrasies of these important magazines in American literary culture.

A first novel. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, February 2001:</b> First-time author David Ellis captures the imagination from the very first page with the voice of Marty Kalish, an investment banker in a tony company. Marty recounts the night that led to the murder of Dr. Derrick Reinhardt, the abusive husband of Rachel, with whom Marty is having an affair. The highly original premise of this story is masterful. Although Marty tells us his involvement in the murder, we don't know exactly what that involvement is. Did he murder or did he cover up? <p> Marty is a hard guy to believe. Like most people, he doesn't always tell all there is to know, so when he is charged with murder and employs the best defense lawyers in the city, he changes his story more than once to insure that he comes out in the best light possible. This both exasperates and earns the respect of his lawyer (as well as the reader), because every story that Marty tells is plausible. He tells us that he meets with a PI, but we won't know why until the last page, and indeed the story does not come together completely until that moment. </p><p> In the meantime, Marty takes us on quite a trip. The courtroom scenes in this novel are among the very best. From jury selection to witness interrogation to sidebars with the judge, the scenes and dialogue crackle with authenticity. The only false note in the story is that although Marty is charged with murder, he remains free on his own recognizance both before and during the trial. There must be precedents here, but it seems odd. However, I was happy to overlook that for the sake of an otherwise convincing and spellbinding story. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>David Ellis is an attorney practicing in Springfield and Chicago, Illinois.

The resulting reality will function according to different rules and we&#x2019;ll know ourselves as a new kind of human being. We&#x2019;ll live in a world that&#x2019;s functioning entirely in the present moment, close to the speed of light. <br> <br>As the world increases in frequency, we&#x2019;re embracing the idea that life improves when we develop our own human abilities to work with energy and sophisticated perception. In <i>Leap of Perception</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn new ways of using your attention that will become normal in the Intuition Age&#x2014;things like direct knowing, undivided attention, flow attention, unified field attention, collective-self attention, and working purposefully with the imaginal realm. <br> <br>You will learn to: <br> <br>� Ease your personal transformation process <br> <br>� Work more effectively with ultrasensitivity and empathy <br> <br>� Shift your &#x201c;geometry of perception&#x201d; from an old linear model to a new spherical-holographic one <br> <br>� Change the relationship between your left and right brain, and use more than your brain to perceive <br> <br>� Use the power of attention&#x2014;not intention&#x2014; to materialize realities in the blink of an eye <br> <br>� Recognize possibilities that haven&#x2019;t yet been able to be imagined <br> <br>The result of this transformative leap of perception will be many &#x201c;new human&#x201d; abilities that previously were thought to be supernatural, and a deep understanding of multidimensional life, where death as we know it no longer exists and there is no &#x201c;other side.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Leap of Perception</i> takes things a step further beyond my previous 2 books, describing the new consciousness, personal identity, and reality we're moving into in the Intuition Age. <br><br>1. There are new ways of perceiving, new perceptual habits, and even new geometries of how we organize the world that are inherent in the Intuition Age, and differ dramatically from what we know today. These are things that can help us now to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- materialize situations we want and need more instantaneously<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- solve conflict in relationships<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- greatly expand our abilities to be innovative and creative<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- deal with ADHD and "speeding," overwhelm, exhaustion from multitasking, shallowness and fragmentation of consciousness that causes mistakes and illness, and more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- ease the fear-based symptoms of the transformation process <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- develop new human skills like telepathy, clairvoyance, applied empathy, rapid healing, and more<br><br>2. I've drawn on neuroplasticity research and an understanding of how the brain, heart, and energy field operate as a vastly expanded single brain center to increase knowledge and sense of self. <br><br>3. I've also drawn on the ancient wisdom of the sages to verify the experience of transformation, which I am re-describing in modern terms for today's mass audience. It's not just rare individuals who are transforming today, it's a planetary process available to everyone.<br><br>4. I'm also describing the process of merging the left and right sides of the brain, as well as the heart and personal energy field. When we do this, something magical happens! We become a new kind of human being.<br><br>I wrote this book because it is really through breaking old perception habits and developing new ways of perceiving that we will most rapidly and easily shift from the Information Age to the Intuition Age. We need to learn to identify "old perception" and how it's draining us, vs. new "skillful perception" and how it causes life to function effortlessly and joyfully. <br><br>We need to experience a felt sense of transformed consciousness so we can know where we're headed. This book will help you speed through the difficult stages of the transformation process and develop the new perceptual abilities, or "attention skills," of the Intuition Age--now.As the vibration of the world continues to accelerate, we are being catalyzed into a new kind of knowing--literally, a leap of perception. We can now clearly see how perception itself creates the world and our life experience. We are rapidly outgrowing "old perception" and are discovering a high-vibrational "new perception" that creates a high-frequency world--one in which oneness, compassion, service, joy, and mutually sourced cocreativity prevail. <br><br><i>Leap of Perception</i> completes Peirce's Transformation Trilogy, offering a comprehensive guide to navigating your transformation process, recognizing the new Intuition Age reality, and living successfully by its new rules. With down-to-earth examples and simple exercises, Peirce deftly translates sophisticated concepts into useful practices to make this complex change--and what comes after--understandable, actionable, and easy to integrate into daily life.</p><h2>Another Kind of Autumn</h2><p>Eiseley, Loren, Another Kind Of Autumn</p><p></p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Bluff (Dragonlance S.: Crossroads)</h2><p>Youthful mage Ulin Majere and his traveling companion head for the port city of Flotsam to identify a murder victim, only to find themselves caught up in a dangerous web of conspiracy, a clever gang of thieves, the Knights of Neraka, and a deadly red dragon that is terrorizing the local populace.

This is where the author grew up, the only son of an aspirant mother and a charming, feckless father who were born into this close-knit community.

Fraught with the timeless&nbsp;dynamic of going home again, encompassing hopes and fears and the relentless tides of familial and individual complications, this&nbsp;story is arresting, comic, heartbreaking, and truly beautiful, an immediate classic.</p></p><p>Richard Russo lives with his wife in Camden, Maine, and Boston.&nbsp;In 2002 he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Empire Falls</i>.<p><b>Prologue<br><br></b>A few years ago, passing the sign on the New York State Thruway for the Central Leatherstocking Region, a friend of mine misread it as saying <i>laughingstock</i> and thought, That must be where Russo&#x2019;s from. She was right. I&#x2019;m from Gloversville, just a few miles north in the foothills of the Adirondacks, a place that&#x2019;s easy to joke about unless you live there, as some of my family still do.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town wasn&#x2019;t always a joke. In its heyday, nine out of ten dress gloves in the United States were manufactured there. By the end of the nineteenth century, craftsmen from all over Europe had flocked in, for decades producing gloves on a par with the finest made anywhere in the world. Back then glove-cutting was governed by a guild, and you typically apprenticed, as my maternal grandfather did, for two or three years. The primary tools of a trained glove-cutter&#x2019;s trade were his eye, his experience of animal skins, and his imagination. It was my grandfather who gave me my first lessons in art&#x2014;though I doubt he would&#x2019;ve worded it like that&#x2014;when he explained the challenge of making something truly fine and beautiful from an imperfect hide. After they&#x2019;re tanned but before they go to the cutter, skins are rolled and brushed and finished to ensure smooth uniformity, but inevitably they retain some of nature&#x2019;s imperfections. The true craftsman, he gave me to understand, works around these flaws or figures out how to incorporate them into the glove&#x2019;s natural folds or stitching. Each skin posed problems whose resolution required creativity. The glove-cutter&#x2019;s job wasn&#x2019;t just to get as many gloves as possible out of a hide but to do so while minimizing its flaws.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leather had been tanned in Fulton County, using the bark of hemlock trees, since before the American Revolution. Gloversville and neighboring Johnstown were home not only to gloves but to all things leather: shoes and coats and handbags and upholstery. My paternal grandfather, from Salerno, Italy, having heard about this place where so many artisans had gathered, journeyed to upstate New York in hopes of making a living there as a shoemaker. From New York City he took the train north to Albany, then west as far as the Barge Canal hamlet of Fonda, where he followed the freight tracks north up to Johnstown, where I was born decades later. Did he have any real idea of where he was headed, or what his new life would be like? You tell me. Among the few material possessions he brought with him from the old country was an opera cape.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both men had wretched timing. My father&#x2019;s father soon learned that Fulton County wasn&#x2019;t Manhattan or even Salerno, and that few men in his new home would buy expensive custom-made shoes instead of cheaper machine-made ones, so he had little choice but to become a shoe repairman. And by the time my mother&#x2019;s father arrived in Gloversville from Vermont, the real craft of glove-cutting was already under assault. By the end of World War I, many gloves were being &#x201c;pattern cut.&#x201d; (For a size 6 glove, a size 6 pattern was affixed to the skin and cut around with shears.) Once he returned from World War II, the process was largely mechanized by &#x201c;clicker-cutting&#x201d; machines that quickly stamped out presized gloves, requiring the operator only to position the tanned skin under the machine&#x2019;s lethal blades and pull down on its mechanical arm. I was born in 1949, by which time there wasn&#x2019;t much demand for handmade gloves or shoes, but both my grandfathers had long since made their big moves to Fulton County and staked their dubious claims. By then they had families, and so there they remained. It was also during the fi rst half of the twentieth century that chrome tanning, a chemical procedure that made leather more supple and water resistant, and dramatically sped up the whole process, became the industry standard, replacing traditional vegetable tanning and making tanneries even more hazardous, not just for workers but also for those who lived nearby and, especially, downstream. Speed, efficiency, and technology had trumped art and craft, not to mention public safety.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, between 1890 and 1950 people in Gloversville made good money, some of them a lot of it. Drive along Kingsboro Avenue, which parallels Main Street, and have a gander at the fine old houses set back from the street and well apart from one another, and you&#x2019;ll get a sense of the prosperity that at least the fortunate ones enjoyed until World War II. Even downtown Gloversville, which by the 1970s had become a Dresdenlike ruin, still shows signs of that wealth. The Andrew Carnegie Gloversville Free Library is as lovely as can be, and the old high school, which sits atop a gentle hill, bespeaks a community that believed both in itself and that good times would not be fleeting. On its sloping lawn stands a statue of Lucius Nathan Littauer, one of the richest men in the county, whose extended arm appears to point at the grand marble edifice of the nearby Eccentric Club, which refused him membership because he was a Jew. Down the street is the recently restored Glove Theatre, where I spent just about every Saturday afternoon of my adolescence. There was also a charming old hotel, the Kingsboro, in whose elegant dining room Monsignor Kreugler, whom I&#x2019;d served as an altar boy at Sacred Heart Church, held weekly court after his last Sunday Mass. Once it was razed, visitors had to stay in nearby Johnstown, out on the arterial highway that was supposed to breathe new life into Gloversville but instead, all too predictably, allowed people to race by, without stopping or even slowing down, en route to Saratoga, Lake George, or Montreal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How quickly it all happened. In the Fifties, on a Saturday afternoon, the streets downtown would be gridlocked with cars honking hellos at pedestrians. The sidewalks were so jammed with shoppers that, as a boy trapped among taller adults, I had to depend on my mother, herself no giant, to navigate us from one store to the next or, more harrowingly, across Main Street. Often, when we finished what we called our weekly &#x201c;errands,&#x201d; my mother and I would stop in at Pedrick&#x2019;s. Located next to city hall, it was a dark, cool place, the only establishment of my youth that was air-conditioned, with a long, thin wall whose service window allowed sodas and cocktails to be passed from the often raucous bar into the more respectable restaurant. Back then Pedrick&#x2019;s was always mobbed, even in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. Mounted on the wall of each booth was a minijukebox whose movable mechanical pages were full of song listings. Selections made here&#x2014;five for a quarter, if memory serves&#x2014;were played on the real jukebox on the far wall. We always played a whole quarter&#x2019;s worth while nursing sodas served so cold they made my teeth hurt. Sometimes, though, the music was drowned out by rowdy male laughter from the bar, where the wall-mounted television was tuned to a Yankees ball game, and if anybody hit a home run everyone in the restaurant knew it immediately. I remember listening intently to all the men&#x2019;s voices, trying to pick out my father&#x2019;s. He and my mother had separated when I was little, but he was still around town, and I always imagined him on the other side of that wall in Pedrick&#x2019;s.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suspected that my mother, if she hadn&#x2019;t been saddled with me, would have preferred to be over there herself. She liked men, liked being among them, and on the restaurant side it was mostly women and kids and older people. Though I couldn&#x2019;t have put it into words, I had the distinct impression that the wall separating respectability from fun was very thin indeed. There was another jukebox in the bar, and sometimes it got cranked up loud enough to compete with whatever was playing on ours, and then my mother would say it was time to go, as if she feared the wall itself might come crashing down. To her, music getting pumped up like that could only mean one thing: that people were dancing, middle of the afternoon or not, and if she&#x2019;d been over there, she would&#x2019;ve been as well. A good decade after the end of World War II, Gloversville was still in a party mode, and regular Saturday<br>festivities routinely continued right up to last call and often beyond, the town&#x2019;s prosperous citizens dancing and drinking at the Eccentric Club, the more middle-class folk in the blue-collar taverns along upper Main Street or, in summer, at the pavilion at nearby Caroga Lake, the poor (often the most recent immigrants with the lowest-paying tannery jobs) in the gin mills bordering South Main in the section of town referred to as &#x201c;the Gut,&#x201d; where arrests for drunkenness or indecency or belligerence were much more likely to be recorded in the local newspaper on Monday than comparable exploits at the Eccentric Club.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I graduated from high school in 1967, you could have strafed Main Street with an automatic weapon without endangering a soul. On Saturday afternoons the sidewalks were deserted, people in newly reduced circumstances shopping for bargains at the cheap, off-brand stores that had sprung up along the arterial. The marquee at the Glove Theatre bore the title of the last film to play there, though enough of the letters were missing that you couldn&#x2019;t guess what it was. Jobless men emerged from the pool hall or one of the seedy gin mills that sold cheap draft beer and rotgut rye, blinking into the afternoon light and fl exing at the knees. Lighting up a smoke, they&#x2019;d peer up Main Street in one direction, then down the other, as if wondering where the hell everybody went. By then the restaurant side of Pedrick&#x2019;s had closed, but since I turned eighteen that summer, now of legal drinking age, the other side was no longer off-limits. Now, though, it was quiet as a library. The Yankees were still playing on the television, but Mantle and Maris and Yogi and Whitey Ford had all retired, and their glory days, like Gloversville&#x2019;s, were over. The half-dozen grizzled, solitary drinkers rotated on their stools when the door opened, like the past might saunter in out of the bright glare trailing ten-dollar bills in its wake. Every now and then that summer of &#x2019;67, I&#x2019;d poke my head into Pedrick&#x2019;s to see if my father was among those drinking Utica Club drafts at the bar. But, like time itself, he, too, had moved on.<br>What happened? Lots of things. After World War II, about when men stopped wearing hats, women stopped wearing gloves. Jackie Kennedy did wear a pair at her husband&#x2019;s inauguration, and that turned the clock back for a while, but the trend proved irreversible. More important, glove making started going overseas where labor was cheap. Gloversville went bust the way Mike Campbell declares his bankruptcy in Hemingway&#x2019;s <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, &#x201c;gradually and then suddenly.&#x201d; The &#x201c;giant sucking sound&#x201d; of globalism arrived decades early and with a vengeance. My maternal grandfather, who, despite being a veteran of two world wars, had been branded a Communist from the pulpit of Sacred Heart Church for being a union man, saw it coming even before crappy Asian-made gloves showed up in the shops, where a few buttons could be sewn on and the gloves stamped MADE IN GLOVERSVILLE. Around Thanksgiving, the trade&#x2019;s off-season, workers in the skin mills got laid off, and every year it took a little longer for them to be called back. Worse, they weren&#x2019;t all rehired at once, which practice allowed the shop owners to remind their employees that things were different now. What mattered was moving inventory down the line, not quality. After all, Asians and Indians were doing what the local stiffs did for a quarter of the cost.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather, who came home from the Pacific with malaria and soon afterward developed emphysema, was by then too sick to fight. He continued to work as always, refusing to cut corners and, as a result, making considerably less money than men for whom slapdash was good enough. The bosses could exploit him, give him the most flawed skins, and treat him like a robot instead of the craftsman he was, but he claimed the one thing they couldn&#x2019;t order him to do was a bad job. But of course they didn&#x2019;t need to. You only had to look at how his narrow, concave chest heaved as he struggled to draw oxygen into his failing lungs to know he wouldn&#x2019;t be anybody&#x2019;s problem much longer. His wife, who&#x2019;d also survived the Depression, foresaw a diminished future. She began stocking the pantry with cans of wax beans and tuna fish earlier every year, aware that the layoffs would run even longer, and her husband, growing sicker by the day, would be among the last called back. Jesus on his best day could do no more with loaves and fishes than my grandmother did with a pound of bacon. Still, it was just a matter of time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of which had much effect on me. As a boy I was happy as a clam in Gloversville. My mother and I shared a modest two-family house on Helwig Street with her parents. They lived in the two-bedroom, single-bath downstairs flat, my mother and I in the identically configured one above. My grandfather, who&#x2019;d never before purchased anything he couldn&#x2019;t pay for with cash out of his wallet, bought the house, I suspect, because he knew his daughter&#x2019;s marriage was on the rocks and that she and I would need a place to live. Our block of Helwig Street was neighborly, with a corner grocery store situated diagonally across the street. My mother&#x2019;s sister and her family lived around the corner on Sixth Avenue, which meant I grew up surrounded by cousins. In kindergarten and first grade, my grandmother walked me to school in the morning and was there to meet me in the afternoon, and in the summer we took walks to a lovely little park a few blocks away. On weekends it was often my grandfather who&#x2019;d take my hand, and together we&#x2019;d head downtown for a bag of &#x201c;peatles,&#x201d; his peculiar word for red-skinned peanuts, stopping on the way back to visit with friends sitting out on their porches. By the time I was old enough to get my first bike and explore beyond Helwig Street, I&#x2019;d discovered the magic of baseball, and so, wooden bat over my shoulder, mitt dangling from my handle-bars, I disappeared with friends for whole mornings or afternoons or both. At my aunt&#x2019;s there was a hoop over the garage, and during the long winters my cousin Greg and I kept the driveway shoveled meticulously so we could shoot baskets, even when it was so cold the net froze and you couldn&#x2019;t dribble the ball. Come autumn I raked leaves, stealing this job from my grandfather, who loved to do it, though he didn&#x2019;t always have sufficient breath. Sometimes he&#x2019;d start the job, and I&#x2019;d finish while he snuck a cigarette around back of the house where my grandmother couldn&#x2019;t see him. Summers I mowed lawns, and winters I shoveled sidewalks.

As<br>a writer of what&#x2019;s called &#x201c;literary nonfiction&#x201d; or &#x201c;creative nonfiction&#x201d;&#x2013;<br>narrative that is said to read like a novel but is factually verifiable&#x2013;<br>it has often been my practice to climb into the soup. Getting<br>boiled with your characters is a good way to get to know them, but it<br>has occasionally led me into frightening situations.<br><br>Some years ago, while I was researching <i>The Hot Zone, </i>a book that<br>focuses on the Ebola virus, I may have had a meeting with an unknown<br>strain of Ebola. (A virus is an exceedingly small life-form, an infectious<br>parasite that replicates inside living cells, using the cell&#x2019;s own machinery<br>to make more copies of itself.)<br><br>Ebola has now been classified into seven different known types.<br>Though it has been studied for more than thirty years, Ebola is one of<br>the least-understood viruses in nature. Scientists have been understandably<br>reluctant to study Ebola too closely because it has on occasion<br>killed those who tried to do so. The virus was first was noticed in<br>1976, when it surfaced in Yambuku, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic<br>of Congo), near the Ebola River, where it sacked a Catholic<br>mission hospital, killing most of the medical staff along with a number<br>of patients and people the patients had came into contact with. Ebola<br>spreads from one person to the next by direct contact with blood or secretions,<br>including sweat. There is no evidence that it can spread<br>among humans through the air, although there is some evidence that<br>it may spread among monkeys this way. As a parasite, Ebola carries on<br>its life cycle in some unidentified type of animal&#x2013;Ebola&#x2019;s natural<br>host&#x2013;that lives in certain unidentified habitats in equatorial Africa.<br>Occasionally Ebola comes into contact with a person, and the virus<br>makes what is known as a trans-species jump from its host into the<br>human species.<br><br>When Ebola gets inside a human host, it causes the person&#x2019;s immune<br>system to vanish, and the person dies with hemorrhages coming<br>from the body&#x2019;s orifices. The most lethal strains of Ebola have been<br>known to kill up to 95 percent of people who become infected with it.<br>Ebola causes people to vomit masses of black blood with a distinctive<br>&#x201c;coffee grounds&#x201d; appearance. Victims can have a bright red nosebleed,<br>or epistaxis; it won&#x2019;t stop. A spotty, bumpy rash spreads over the body,<br>while small, starlike hemorrhages appear beneath the skin. An Ebola<br>patient can have blood standing in droplets on the eyelids and running<br>from the tear ducts down the face. Blood can flow from the nose,<br>mouth, vagina, rectum. The testicles can become infected with Ebola<br>and can swell up or be destroyed. Victims display signs of psychosis.<br>They can develop endless hiccups. Rarely, in particularly severe cases of<br>Ebola, the linings of the intestines and rectum may come off. Those<br>membranes may be expelled through the anus in raglike pieces called<br>casts, or the intestinal lining can emerge in the form of a sleeve, like a<br>sock. When an Ebola patient expels a sleeve, it is known as throwing a<br>tubular cast.<br><br>Some of the action in <i>The Hot Zone </i>takes place at Fort Detrick, an<br>Army base in the rolling country along the eastern flank of the Appalachian<br>Mountains in Maryland, an hour&#x2019;s drive northwest of Washington,<br>D.C. The Army&#x2019;s Level 4 virus laboratories at Fort Detrick are<br>clustered inside a large, nearly windowless building that sits near the<br>eastern perimeter of the base. This building is the headquarters of the<br>United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases,<br>or USAMRIID&#x2013;a facility that Army people often simply refer to as &#x201c;the<br>Institute.&#x201d; While I was visiting USAMRIID, or the Institute, to interview<br>various experts in Ebola, I began asking officials at the base for per-<br>mission to put on a biohazard space suit and enter one of the Army&#x2019;s<br>Biosafety Level 4 virus laboratories. I wanted to get a firsthand look at<br>researchers handling Ebola. More than that, I wanted to know what it<br>feels like to wear a biohazard space suit and be face-to-face with a real<br>Level 4 virus, so that I could get a sense of my characters&#x2019; feelings and<br>experiences, and could describe them with convincing precision.<br>(Many nonfiction writers refer to their characters as &#x201c;subjects,&#x201d; but I<br>prefer to think of them as dramatis personae in a true story.)<br><br>Biosafety Level 4, also called BL-4 or Level 4, is the highest and<br>tightest level of biosecurity in a laboratory. Laboratories rated at<br>Biosafety Level 4 are the repositories of viruses called hot agents&#x2013;<br>lethal viruses for which there is no vaccine or effective cure. Level 4<br>labs are sealed off from the outside world. People who go inside a<br>Level 4 lab are required to wear a biohazard space suit, a pressurized<br>whole-body suit, like an astronaut&#x2019;s, made of soft, flexible plastic, typically<br>blue. Army researchers sometimes refer to the space suit as a<br>&#x201c;blue suit&#x201d; because of its color. A soft, flexible helmet that completely<br>surrounds the head is joined to the suit, and the helmet has a clear,<br>flexible plastic faceplate in it; the suit also has an independent air supply.<br>The air supply prevents you from breathing the air inside the lab,<br>which could be contaminated with a hot agent. Ebola virus is classified<br>as a Level 4 hot agent, one of the most dangerous known, and it has<br>the potential to be used as a biological weapon. The scientists at<br>USAMRIID (it&#x2019;s pronounced &#x201c;you-SAM-rid&#x201d;) conduct research into<br>vaccines and drugs that could be used to protect the population of the<br>United States against a terrorist or military attack with a biological<br>weapon, including Ebola virus. This is medical research, peaceful in nature.<br><br>The Level 4 labs inside the Institute consist of groups of interconnected<br>rooms. Each group of rooms is known as a hot suite or a hot<br>zone. Each suite is sealed off from the outside world and is accessible<br>only through an air lock. The air lock has heavy, stainless steel doors.<br>Inside the air lock there is a chemical decontamination shower, also<br>known as a &#x201c;decon&#x201d; shower. The purpose of the decon shower is to<br>sterilize the outer surface of the space suits of researchers who are leaving<br>a hot zone, to prevent a hot agent from getting a ride to the out<i> </i>side world. <br>Chest freezers inside the Army&#x2019;s hot zones are filled with<i><br></i>collections of microvials (tiny plastic test tubes the size of a pencil stub)<br>that contain frozen or freeze-dried samples of many different strains of<br>lethal viruses.<br><br>The freezers are kept at 95 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. They<br>are said to be hot. They are hot in a biological sense: they contain<br>frozen samples of lethal viruses that are held in suspended animation in<br>the extreme cold. The virus collections stored in USAMRIID&#x2019;s hot freezers<br>are said to include strains of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever virus, Guanarito<br>virus, Jun�n virus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan equine<br>encephalitis (VEE), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Hendra virus,<br>Nipah virus, Lassa virus, and the seven known types of Ebola. (These<br>viruses&#x2019; effects on humans vary. Guanarito, Jun�n, and Lassa, for example,<br>cause hemorrhaging from the body&#x2019;s orifices, like Ebola. VEE and<br>JEV infect the brain and spinal cord, causing coma or death. Nipah is a<br>brain virus from Malaysia that can trigger a literal meltdown of the<br>brain. The brain of a Nipah victim can be semiliquefied as the virus consumes<br>it, and can pour out of the skull during an autopsy.) The hot<br>freezers also may contain (although the Army doesn&#x2019;t say much about<br>this) an assortment of Level 4 Unknown viruses, or X viruses. The Unknown<br>X viruses <i>appear </i>to be lethal in humans, but little is known<br>about them. They&#x2019;ve never been fully studied or classified. They may include<br>something known as the Link�ping Samples, which may or may<br>not harbor an unidentified type of Ebola. The X viruses are presumed<br>to be potentially lethal, so they are kept in Level 4 for safety.<br><br>We know that Ebola virus was one of the more powerful<br>bioweapons in the arsenal of the old Soviet Union. In the years before<br>the Soviet Union broke up, in 1991, bioweaponeers had reportedly<br>been experimenting with aerosol Ebola&#x2013;powdered, weaponized<br>Ebola that could be dispersed through the air, over a city, for example.<br>The Soviet weaponized Ebola was apparently stable enough that it<br>could drift for distances in the air and still infect people through the<br>lungs when they breathed a few particles of it. This is why the U.S.<br>Army was studying it: the Army researchers were trying to come up<br>with a vaccine or a drug treatment for Ebola, in case of a terrorist or<br>military attack on the United States with Ebola.<br><br>As a natural disease, Ebola virus does not seem to be able to pass<br>from person to person through the air, though. In each of the natural<br>Ebola outbreaks, the disease seems to burn itself out, and Ebola fades<br>away and is lost in the backdrop of nature, until, once again, by chance,<br>it finds its way into a human host.<br><br>One day I was interviewing the commander of Fort Detrick. We<br>were getting toward the end of the interview, and I decided to ask one<br>last question. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to try to convey to readers what it really feels like<br>to be face-to-face with Ebol...</p><h2>Bonjour, Babar!: The Six Unabridged Classics by the Creator of Babar</h2><p>In 1931 Jean de Brunhoff created Babar, a little elephant who walked out of the jungle and into the hearts of civilized readers the world over. Widely recognized as the father of the picture book, Jean de Brunhoff wrote and illustrated six Babar stories before his early death in 1937. Every word and every picture of these classics is included in this big, inviting gift edition.</p><p>Seven decades after Babar was born, the world is still very much in love with the noble elephant. Before his untimely death at age 37, Jean de Brunhoff wrote and illustrated six stories about Babar and his friends and family. In this exquisite gift edition, every one of these stories is included, with not a word or picture left out. From <i>The Story of Babar</i>--in which the elephant is born, loses his mother, runs off to Paris, and returns to be crowned king--through <i>The Travels of Babar</i>, <i>Babar the King</i>, <i>Babar and Zephir</i>, <i>Babar and His Children</i>, and <i>Babar and Father Christmas</i>, the beloved pachyderm's incredible life adventures are chronicled for our reading pleasure. In his introduction, picture book author-illustrator Kevin Henkes writes, "Where else could one find a balloon accident, a deadly poison mushroom, a runaway carriage, an extraordinary flying machine, a snake attack, fire, war, death, birth? These books are full of adventure and fantasy, but they also deal with the stuff of real life. And I'm convinced children long to see both the dark and the light sides of human experience reflected in their books just as much as adults do, perhaps more." Adults who truly wish to share the joys of the classics with the children in their lives could do no better than to present them with this grand collection.

He lives in Urbana, Illinois.Childhood innocence--imperiled through the ages and nowhere more at risk than in the heart of modern Los Angeles--stands as the imposing theme of Powers's latest complex, wrenching saga. As overwhelming and erudite as its acclaimed predecessor, The Gold Bug Variations (1991), here evidence of children at odds with the adult world in which they live abounds, from the legend of the Pied Piper to tragic details of the Children's Crusade to more recent obliterations of youthful dreams in Southeast Asia and Watts. Holding this savage, sorrowful indictment of post-adolescent behavior together is the tale of a pediatrics ward in an inner-city hospital, into which the world's indigent wounded are thrown with abandon. Cared for by a fiercely protective therapist and a sensitive surgical resident--themselves careworn and devastated by traumas of youth, but seeking redemption--the ward acquires a life and plan of its own when Joy, a Laotian boat girl whose ravenous appetite for knowledge cannot stave off the rot consuming her from the ankles up, and Nicolino, a street-wise, shrewd trader in comics and other commodities wizened well before his time by Methuselah Syndrome, take the situation in hand. Using a ward-wide production of the Pied Piper story presented to the outside world as their means, they plot a mass escape in order to become masters of their own fates--but their designs for liberation falter before the realities of disease and adult agendas. Mingling wisps of whimsy and a hard-edged, surgical view, this cuts deeply into the human condition--to a dark, profoundly troubled place where hope and despair exist side by side. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As the world s senior Western bhikkhu, ordained in 1903, Nyanatiloka attracted many disciples, through whose work his influence continues to be felt today, more than fifty years after his death. Nyanatiloka was also a renowned scholar and translator of Pali scriptures. His classic The Word of the Buddha, written more than a century ago, is still widely read. The core of this volume consists of a translation of Nyanatiloka s autobiography, written in German when he was forty-eight. The remaining thirty-one years of his life, from 1926 until 1957, are presented as a biographical postscript, drawn from other sources.</p><p></p><h2>World Atlas</h2><p>National Geographic's classic atlas for kids is now fully revised and updated, with a reduced trim that makes it easy to carry and easy to browse.

The sun bakes at ninety and the humidity keeps stride with the sun. Texas wobbles under the blows of summer, the storms threaten, the whiff of tornadoes gives a tang to the changing skies. The street is tree-clogged, narrow, and lined with stretch versions of ranch-style houses. Plano, hugging the north flank of Dallas, is one of the richest suburbs in the United States. This section of that sanctuary houses managers, the lower end of the Plano pecking order. Weekends reverberate with lawn mowers, weekdays find the street abandoned as couples work to pay for their homes. </p><p> The woman scrubs diligently in the kitchen. Not compulsively, she notes, just rigorously. She is short and friendly. She was born in Mexico and raised in the United States and most of her life has revolved around the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. This is not her home, she is just helping out. This could never be her home. Everything about the house is wrong. It reeks of a failed marriage, of depression. And of Anglos. This last failing is never mentioned, it is too obvious for mention. Anglos mean a cold world, a soulless world, a place where there may be money but something essential is always missing. </p><p> That is why she is here. He's gone now, doing errands, but she is here to fill this missing thing, unnamed, unmentioned, but obvious. Too obvious to discuss. She has been tied to him most of his life, through his single time, the second marriage, and now with the new divorce she is, well, back in the picture. She is bright and works hard. And she prides herself on being practical, on not succumbing to the fatal temptations of the imagination, and this house is not practical nor is this place. Nor is this thing about the death. </p><p> "They have to let Bruno go, leave him in peace," she offers. </p><p> "But that's hard when he's your own brother," I reply. I don't mention the glass of water and the candle. </p><p> She nods, but still she knows. </p><p> She has been busy telling me everything, about the details of the ruin, the little discrete acts, the betrayals, the hopes dashed. And the hopes once again renewed, just as the hopeless kitchen counter is being renewed as it emerges from months of neglect and begins to shine and smell fresh once again. She is preparing the playing field for her chicken tacos. It has not been easy. The cilantro, for example, sold in Plano is not really cilantro. Here, smell it. See? It is off, like something dead, something faint and lacking soul. </p><p> "Phillip," she announces, and she always calls him Phillip even though every one else calls him Phil, "has to stop this stuff about drugs. It is all he wants to talk about. I go to Mexico and I see hotels and nice businesses and at the trade conferences, no one talks about drugs. And I don't see drugs. He has to stop this." </p><p> "But that is not easy," I reply. "It is everywhere if you look, if you know how to look. It is too big to ignore." </p><p> And then I trail off because I understand her point. It is a healthy point. </p><p> I can't even produce a metaphor for the drug world anymore. I don't even like the phrase the drug world since the phrase implies that it is a separate world. And drugs are as basic and American as, say, Citibank. Mexico's three leading official sources of foreign exchange are oil, tourism, and the money sent home by Mexicans in the United States. Drugs bring Mexico more money than these three sources combined. The United States and Mexico share a common border more than 1,800 miles long. Its official, licit, World Bank-type economy is piddling -- 4.5 percent that of the United States. Both nations, along with Canada, are officially partners in a common market under the umbrella of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mexico and the United States are partners in an unofficial economy called the drug business. </p><p> The number for the money in the Mexican drug business, around $30 billion annually, came from the Mexican attorney general's office in the mid-1990s, and is smaller than the current take. The number is roughly the same as that quietly issued from time to time by the agencies of the United States government. </p><p> When the drug industry does get mentioned, it gets dismissed by Mexicans blaming the United States for creating the drug market because of its vile habits and the United States blaming Mexico for permitting the drug industry because of its corrupt practices. I disagree with both positions. Drugs are a business, one of the largest on the surface of the earth, and this business exists for two reasons: the products are so very, very good and the profits are so very, very high. Nothing that creates hundreds of billions of dollars of income annually and is desired by millions of people will be stopped by any nation on this earth. A Mexican study by the nation's internal security agency, CISEN (Centro de Investigaci�n y Seguridad Nacional), that has been leaked to the press speculates that if the drug business vanished, the U.S. economy would shrink 19 to 22 percent, the Mexican 63 percent. I stare at these numbers and have no idea if they are sound or accurate. No one can really grapple with the numbers because illegal enterprises can be glimpsed but not measured. In 1995, one Mexican drug-trafficking expert guessed that half the hotel room revenues in his country were frauds, meaning empty rooms counted as sold in order to launder drug money. </p><p> A part of me sympathizes with the woman cleaning the kitchen that is not hers, that is a relic of her lover's failed marriage. I can taste the desire to move on, to leave all the arrests, tortures, corrupt politicians and cops on both sides of the line, to abandon talk of deals and busts. To smell the roses and let the cocaine go to hell or the customers. Outside in the yard, a small dog lazes in the sun, a mongrel from El Paso. The dog is called Cokie, short for Cocaine. And here, the dog's world has been reduced to the decent order of bones, water, a food dish, and two rubber balls for play. The trick is to pretend Mexico does not exist. Or if it does exist, that it is very much like the United States, just with a different cuisine and language. For decades the man of this house kept Mexico at bay. And then, it came visiting in a form that trade agreements and folkloric dances tend to ignore. </p><p> The visit was violent. In Ju�rez, the Mexican city just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, the world has been reduced to this: between 1993 and 2001, at least 2,800 people were either murdered or raped or kidnapped or simply vanished. In Mexico City, the attorney general's office has placed the mug shots of 1,400 federales on a Web site to better enable citizens to identify them when they rob or torture them or, perhaps, kill someone. A Mexico City suburb has followed suit with its police force so that, the mayor explains, the local citizens can protect themselves from the community's eight hundred cops. The mayor already had fired half of the force for corruption. Recently, one Mexican politician called for reinstating capital punishment in Mexico -- solely for police offenders. </p><p> The house is cluttered with DEA bric-a-brac -- plaques, citations, photographs, the litter from a career. The woman wants such things gone, consigned to the past. She wants the breath of a fresh, new life. There is a logic to this since in the end this work with DEA has brought ruin. Yet, it is hard to let it go. It is hard to pretend it never happened. Others can do this, but for those who were involved in the blood rituals such an act requires personal mutilation. I understand this dread of burying the past at the very same instant I share her desire to erase it. Or better yet, to have never known it at all. </p><p> There are things -- the gulag of slave labor camps in the former Soviet Union, the burning bodies of the Holocaust in Europe, the clanking chains of human bondage in the United States -- that intelligent and honest people know occurred and yet grow weary of contemplating. The drug business is not like such things. Beyond some songs, a few action-packed movies, the drug business is never really acknowledged. Drugs may be the major American story of our era, the thing that did more to alter behavior and law, that redistributed income to the poor far more dramatically than any tinkering with tax codes, that jailed more people and killed more people than any U.S. foreign policy initiative since the Vietnam War. But this vital force, this full-tilt-boogie economic activity, is absent from our daily consciousness and only surfaces when discussed as a problem. And this problem is always placed on the other side of town or the other side of a line or the other side of the river. </p><p> Imagine over a quarter of a trillion dollars in a decade, imagine thousands of murders in a decade. Then imagine such things never existed. That is the drug business in one impoverished nation, Mexico. On the U.S. side of the line, all the numbers and consequences are larger. </p><p> The woman is right. Clear the house of this clutter, sell it, move on. </p><p> But there are these things, strands I think, yes, strands weaving together to form a tapestry. In this instance, the tapestry has these little loose ends that are visible, but the weave and tapestry themselves are not. One tiny strand involves Matamoros, the Mexican town facing Brownsville on the Rio Grande. A dozen or so men armed with automatic weapons took over the three-story state police station there one afternoon this season. They carried AK-47s, wore bulletproof vests and masks, and at first the state police thought it was nothing, simply some prank being played by the federal police. The men seized a Mexican soldier being held in a kidnapping case. When they finally left they showered the police station with bullets. In 1984, a similar group of men took over a Matamoros hospital where a business rival was being treated. They left five dead. Then there was a prison riot in 1991 when a drug group took over and burned the place to the ground. Or the time when Juan Garc�a Abrego, the business leader of Matamoros, caused some headlines by kidnapping an American and ritually sacrificing him in pursuit of insights. Garc�a Abrego had lineage and was intertwined with the family that ruled Mexico, including the man then occupying the presidency. And then there was the matter of American FBI and DEA agents held down at gunpoint in broad daylight for twenty minutes on November 9, 1999, and the gunmen demanded they give up an informant, and some of the gunmen were cops and some were cartel members, and one gunman sported a gold-plated AK-47, a problem that one of Phil's cousins, a man named Sal, had to investigate and try to iron out. All of this, these strands from an invisible tapestry, all of these strands are merely details in the life of a huge ongoing organism, something called the Gulf cartel, and the Gulf cartel is but a small part of the pattern of the giant tapestry itself, and like the other parts of the tapestry, the Gulf cartel comes and goes in official consciousness. It is said to be a criminal group and from time to time there are reports it is on the run. There is a fistful of such businesses, cartels, on the line and, most days, they barely exist in the newspapers or the government meetings or the idle chat at the counters of the coffee shops. This recent episode -- where an entire state police station is seized -- will pass and soon it will never have happened at all. </p><p> Just as the songs that flutter across Mexican radio come and go seemingly without a trace. The safe house, the one owned by Phil Jordan on the quiet street just north of Dallas, is in a community where, for the past several years, the adolescents of all those affluent parents have been busy overdosing on heroin. For a while, this was news and then, like the narco songs of Mexico, the dying seemed to slip away and become forgotten. In Mexico, the songs remember, </p><p><br> <i>From Cuchillo Parado in the state of Chihuahua </i></p><p><i> Flew a magnificent eagle </i></p><p><i> Carrying a load as his master had ordered </i></p><p><i> Wearing a bulletproof vest, like he was human </i></p><p><i> And with a kilo of white powder in his talons </i></p><p><i> In the city of Dallas, they were waiting for the eagle...</i> </p><p><br> The woman is right, I know she is right. </p><p> So I ask her about chiles, which kind is she going to use in the tacos, and she says jalape�os and also some sweet yellow peppers. Plus, of course, a <i>salsa cruda</i> she will create. I can taste the chiles on my tongue, smell the meat frying in the pan, feel the warm tortillas. This is a better country, clearly she is right in this matter. </p><p> The drug business lacks any honest metaphors, as I have mentioned. The common ones such as drug lords and drug czars are falsely grand. It is simply a business and like all businesses it has merchants and like all merchants they have power and access to people in power. The merchants are natural lobbyists. They are strictly business. I do not think drug merchants would ever have come to any particular notice except for the fact that they sold a product which gives people pleasure and threatens the shackles of government control. Nor would even these conditions have mattered if they sold materials that had evolved in Europe and been slowly absorbed, like alcohol, into the fabric of governments and banks and capitalism. But of course, this is not how it all happened and so we are left with a secret commerce and secret events and a secret structure. And with enormous profits. We are left with a history unwritten, one almost erased as soon as it happens to hit the page. </p><p> This unwritten history takes place down by the river, on the fabled banks where two nations meet. The official history is about the corruption of Mexico. The unwritten history, or the one that is almost instantly erased, is about the corruption of both nations. In this unwritten history, the drug merchants are almost the only honest players: vicious, greedy, murderous, and candid about their behavior. They are also the only real defenders of cutthroat capitalism since they literally cut throats and employ people based on their talents and with little regard to their sex, race, class, color, or religion. They are also one of the few industries in the developing sectors of the earth that really do redistribute income and do so at a level without parallel in the thousands of assembly plants now employing the poor of the planet. </p><p> Phil will be back in a while, the kitchen will sparkle, the tacos will blaze on the tongue. The house will be cleaned, probably put up for sale, and what happened here will also be erased. And the tendrils of power and corruption and pain that reach into this house will be snipped and destroyed and no trace of their existence will be left. Sanity will be restored. The photo on the refrigerator, the one staring out at this very instant, will be gone. She has not gotten to the refrigerator yet, but she surely will. Bruno will go into a file, be remembered but seldom mentioned. He will become a brother lost to a secret time and business. </p><p> I can't argue with her, not at all. But like Phil, I just can't seem to live her way, follow this path of clarit...</p></p><h2>The White Rose</h2><p>She is the last hope of good in the war against the evil sorceress known as the Lady.

The riders seemed frozen in time, moving without drawing closer. We took turns counting. I could not get the same number twice running.<br>A breath of a breeze whined in the coral, stirred the leaves of Old Father Tree. They tinkled off one another with the song of wind chimes. To the north, the glimmer of change lightning limned the horizon like the far clash of warring gods.<br>A foot crunched sand. I turned. Silent gawked at a talking menhir. It had appeared in the past few seconds, startling him. Sneaky rocks. Like to play games.<br>"There are strangers on the Plain," it said.<br>I jumped. It chuckled. Menhirs have the most malevolent laughs this side of fairy stories. Snarling, I ducked into its shadow. "Hot out here already." And: "That's One-Eye and Goblin, back from Tanner."<br>It was right and I was wrong. I was too narrowly focused. The patrol had been away a month longer than planned. We were worried. Lately the Lady's troops have been more active along the bounds of the Plain of Fear.<br>Another chuckle from the block of stone.<br>It towered over me, thirteen feet tall. A middle-sized one. Those over fifteen feet-seldom move.<br>The riders were closer, yet seemed no nearer. Blame nerves. Times are desperate for the Black Company. We cannot afford casualties. Any man lost would be a friend of many years. I counted again. Seemed right this time. But there was a riderless mount....I shivered despite the heat.<br>They were on the downtrail leading to a creek three hundred yards from where we watched, concealed within a great reef. The walking trees beside the ford stirred, though the breeze had failed.<br>The riders urged their mounts to hurry. The animals were tired. They were reluctant, though they knew they were almost home. Into the creek. Water splashing. I grinned, pounded Silent's back. They were all there. Every man, and another.<br>Silent shed his customary cool, returned a smile. Elmo slipped out of the coral and went to meet our brethren. Otto, Silent, and I hurried after him.<br>Behind us, the morning sun was a great seething ball of blood.<br>Men piled off horses, grinning. But they looked bad. Goblin and One-Eye worst of all. But they had come back to territory where their wizards' powers were useless. This near Darling they are no greater than the rest of us.<br>I glanced back. Darling had come to the head of the tunnel, stood like a phantom in its shadow, all in white.<br>Men hugged men; then old habit took charge. Everybody pretended it was just another day. "Rough out there?" I asked One-Eye. I considered the man accompanying them. He was not familiar.<br>"Yes." The dried-up little black man was more diminished than first I had thought.<br>"You all right?"<br>"Took an arrow." He rubbed his side. "Flesh wound."<br>&nbsp;From behind One-Eye, Goblin squeaked, "They almost got us. Been chasing us a month. We couldn't shake them."<br>"Let's get you down in the Hole," I told One-Eye.<br>"Not infected. I cleared it."<br>"I still want a look." He has been my assistant since I enlisted as Company physician. His judgment is sound. Yet health is my responsibility, ultimately.<br>"They were waiting for us, Croaker." Darling was gone from the mouth of the tunnel, back to the stomach of our subterranean fastness. The sun remained bloody in the east, legacy of the change storm's passing. Something big drifted across its face. Windwhale?<br>"Ambush?" I glanced back at the patrol.<br>"Not us specifically. For trouble. They were on the ball." The patrol had had a double mission: to contact our sympathizers in Tanner to find out if the Lady's people were coming alive after a long hiatus, and to raid the garrison there in order to prove we could hurt an empire that bestrides half a world.<br>As we passed it the menhir said, "There are strangers on the Plain, Croaker."<br>Why do these things happen to me?

Then two dusty little boots dangled above his horse's abruptly nervous eyes, and the matter became a great deal simpler.</p> <p>"Out of the tree, child, lest you spook some unsuspecting traveler's mount."</p> <p>A pair of slim white calves flashed among the branches, the movement provoking the damned horse to dancing and propping.</p> <p>"What's his name?"</p> <p>The question was almost unintelligible, so thick was the burr.</p> <p>"His name is Flying Rowan," Tye said, stroking a hand down the horse's crest. "And he'd better settle himself down this instant if he knows what's good for him. His efforts in this regard would be greatly facilitated if you'd vacate that damned tree."</p> <p>"You shouldn't swear at her. She's a wonderful tree."</p> <p>The horse settled, having had as much frolic as Tye was inclined to permit.</p> <p>"In the first place, trees do not have gender, in the second, your heathen accent makes your discourse nigh incomprehensible, and in the third, please get the hell out of the tree."</p> <p>"Introduce yourself. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers."</p> <p>A heathen child with manners. What else did he expect from the wilds of Aberdeenshire?</p> <p>"Tiberius Lamartine Flynn, Earl of Spathfoy, at your service. Had we any mutual acquaintances, I'd have them attend to the civilities."</p> <p>Silence from the tree, while Tye felt the idiot horse tensing for another display of nonsense.</p> <p>"You're wrong-we have a mutual acquaintance. This is a treaty oak. She's everybody's friend. I'm Fee."</p> <p>Except in his Englishness, Tye first thought the little scamp had said, "I'm fey," which seemed appropriate.</p> <p>"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Fee. Now show yourself like a gentleman, or I'll think it's your intent to drop onto hapless travelers and rob them blind."</p> <p>"Do you think I could?"</p> <p>Dear God, the child sounded fascinated.</p> <p>"Down. Now." That tone of voice had worked on Tye's younger brother until Gordie had been almost twelve. The same tone had ever been a source of amusement to his younger sisters. The branches moved, and Rowan tensed again, haunches bunching as if he'd bolt.</p> <p>A lithe little shape plummeted at least eight feet to the ground and landed with a loud "Ouch!" provoking Rowan to rear in earnest.</p> <p>***</p> <p>From the ground, the horse looked enormous, and the man astride like a giant. Fee caught an impression of darkness-dark horse, dark riding clothes, and a dark scowl as the man tried to control his horse.</p> <p>"That is quite enough out of you." The man's voice was so stern, Fee suspected the horse understood the words, for two large iron-shod hooves came to a standstill not a foot from her head.</p> <p>"Child, you will get up slowly and move away from the horse. I cannot guarantee your safety otherwise."</p> <p>Still stern-maybe this fellow was always stern, in which case he was to be pitied. Fee sat up and tried to creep back on her hands, backside, and feet, but pain shot through her left ankle and up her calf before she'd shifted half her weight.</p> <p>"I hurt myself."</p> <p>The horse backed a good ten feet away, though Fee couldn't see how the rider had asked it to do so.</p> <p>"Where are you hurt?"</p> <p>"My foot. I think I landed on it wrong. It's because I'm wearing shoes."</p> <p>"Shoes do not cause injury." He swung off the horse and shook a gloved finger at the animal. "You stand, or you'll be stewed up for the poor of the parish."</p> <p>"Are you always so mean, mister?"</p> <p>He loomed above her, hands on his hips, and Fee's Aunt Hester would have said he looked like The Wrath of God. His nose was a Wrath-of-God sort of nose, nothing sweet or humble about it, and his eyes were Wrath-of-God eyes, all dark and glaring.</p> <p>He was as tall as the Wrath of God, too, maybe even taller than Fee's uncles, who, if not exactly the Wrath of God, could sometimes be the Wrath of Deeside and greater Aberdeenshire.</p> <p>As could her aunt Hester, which was a sobering thought.</p> <p>"You think I'm mean, young lady?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then I must answer in the affirmative."</p> <p>She frowned up at him. From his accent, he was at least a bloody Lowlander, or possibly a damned Sassenach, but even making those very significant allowances, he still talked funny.</p> <p>"What is a firmative?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am mean. Can you walk?"</p> <p>He extended a hand down to her, a very large hand in a black riding glove. Fee had seen some pictures in a book once, of a lot of cupids without nappies bouncing around with harps, and a hand very like that one, sticking out of the clouds, except the hand in the picture was not swathed in black leather.</p> <p>"Child, I do not have all day to impersonate the Good Samaritan."</p> <p>"The Good Samaritan was nice. He went to heaven."</p> <p>"While it is my sorry fate to be ruralizing in Scotland." He hauled Fee to her feet by virtue of lifting her up under the arms. He did this without effort, as if he hoisted five stone of little girl from the roadside for regular amusement.</p> <p>"Do you ever smile?"</p> <p>"When in the presence of silent, well-behaved, properly scrubbed children, I sometimes consider the notion. Can you put weight on that foot?"</p> <p>"It hurts. I think it hurts because my shoe is getting too tight."</p> <p>He muttered something under his breath, which might have had some bad words mixed in with more of his pernickety accent, then lifted Fee to his hip. "I am forced by the requirements of good breeding and honor to endure your company in the saddle for however long it takes to return you to the dubious care of your wardens, and may God pity them that responsibility."</p> <p>"I get to ride your horse?"</p> <p>"We get to ride my horse. If you were a boy, I'd leave you here to the mercy of passing strangers or allow you to crawl home."</p> <p>He might have been teasing. The accent made it difficult to tell-as did the scowl. "You thought I was boy?"</p> <p>"Don't sound so pleased. I thought you were a nuisance, and I still do. Can you balance?"</p> <p>He deposited her next to the treaty oak, which meant she could stand on one foot and lean on the tree. "I want to take my shoes off." He wrinkled that big nose of his, looking like he smelled something rank. "My feet are clean. Aunt Hester makes me take a bath every night whether I need one or not."</p> <p>This Abomination Against the Natural Order-another one of Aunt Hester's terms-did not appear to impress the man. Fee wondered if anything impressed him-and what a poverty that would be, as Aunt would say, to go through the whole day without once being impressed.</p> <p>He hunkered before her, and he was even tall when he knelt. "Put your hand on my shoulder."</p> <p>Fee complied, finding his shoulder every bit as sturdy as the oak. He unlaced her boot, but when he tried to ease it off her foot, she had to squeal with the pain of it.</p> <p>"Wrenched it properly, then. Here." He pulled off his gloves and passed them to her. "Bite down on one of those, hard enough to cut right through the leather, and scream if you have to. I have every confidence you can ruin my hearing if you make half an effort."</p> <p>She took the gloves, which were warm and supple. "Are you an uncle?"</p> <p>"As it happens, this dolorous fate has befallen me."</p> <p>"Is that a firmative?"</p> <p>"It is. Why?"</p> <p>"Because you're trying to distract me, which is something my uncles do a lot. I won't scream."</p> <p>He regarded her for a moment, looking almost as if he might say something not quite so fussy, then bent to glare at her boot. "Suit yourself, as it appears you are in the habit of doing."</p> <p>She braced herself; she even put one of the riding gloves between her teeth, because as badly as her ankle hurt, she expected taking off her boot would cause the kind of pain that made her ears roar and her vision dim around the edges.</p> <p>She neither screamed nor bit through the glove-which tasted like reins and horse-because before she could even draw in a proper breath, her boot was gently eased off her foot.</p> <p>"I suppose you want the other one off too?"</p> <p>"Is my ankle all bruised and horrible?"</p> <p>"Your ankle is slightly swollen. It will likely be bruised before the day is out, but perhaps not horribly if we can get ice on it."</p> <p>"Are you a priest?"</p> <p>"For pity's sake, child. First an uncle, then a priest? What can you be thinking?" He sat her in the grass and started unlacing her second boot.</p> <p>"You talk like Vicar on Sunday, though on Saturday night, he sounds like everybody else when he's having his pint. If my ankle is awful, Aunt Hester will cry and feed me shortbread with my tea. She might even play cards with me. My uncles taught me how to cheat, but explained I must never cheat unless I'm playing with them."</p> <p>"Honor among thieves being the invention of the Scots, this does not surprise me." He tied the laces of both boots into a knot and slung them around Fee's neck.</p> <p>"I'm a Scot."</p> <p>His lips quirked. Maybe this was what it looked like when the Wrath of God was afraid he might smile.</p> <p>"My condolences. Except for your unfortunate red hair, execrable accent, and the layer of dirt about your person, I would never have suspected." He lifted her up again, but this time carried her to Flying Rowan, who had stood like a good boy all the while the man had been getting Fee's boots off.</p> <p>"I have wonderful hair, just like my mama's. My papa says I'm going to be bee-yoo-ti-full. My uncles say I already am."</p> <p>"What you are is impertinent and inconvenient, though one can hardly blame your hair on you. Up you go." He deposited her in the saddle, bracing a hand around her middle until she had her balance.</p> <p>"Oh, this is a wonderful adventure. May I have the reins?"</p> <p>"Assuredly not. Lean forward."</p> <p>He was up behind her in nothing flat, but that just made it all the better. Flying Rowan was even taller than Uncle Ian's gelding, and almost as broad as the plow horses. Having the solid bulk of an adult male in the saddle made the whole business safe, even as it was also exciting.</p> <p>He nudged the horse forward. "Where I am taking you, child?"</p> <p>Fee could feel the way he rode, feel the way he moved with the horse and communicated with the horse without really using the reins.</p> <p>"Child?"</p> <p>"That way." She lifted her hand to point in the direction of the manor, feeling the horse flinch beneath her as she did. "If you go by way of the pastures, it's shorter than the road."</p> <p>"How many gates?"</p> <p>"Lots. Papa has a lot of doddies."</p> <p>"Has your upbringing acquainted you with the equestrian arts?"</p> <p>He didn't even sound like a priest. He sounded like nothing and no one Fee had ever heard before. His voice was stern but somehow beautiful too, even when he wasn't making any sense at all. "I don't know what equestrian arts are."</p> <p>"Do you ride horseback?" He spoke slowly, as if Fee were daft, which made her want to drive her elbow back into his ribs-though that would likely hurt her elbow.</p> <p>"I don't have a pony, but my uncles take me up when I pester them hard enough."</p> <p>"That will serve. Grab some mane and don't squeal."</p> <p>He wrapped that big hand around her middle again, and urged the horse into a rocking canter. The wind blew Fee's hair back, and it was hard not to squeal, so delightful was the sensation of flying over the ground.</p> <p>"Hold tight." This was nearly growled as the man leaned forward, necessitating that Fee lean forward too. In a mighty surge, the horse leapt up and over a stone wall, then thundered off across the pasture in perfect rhythm.</p> <p>The sensations were magnificent, to be borne aloft for a timeless moment, to soar above the earth, to be safe and snug in the midst of flight.</p> <p>"Do another one!" Fee called over her shoulder, even as the horse bore down on a second wall.</p> <p>They did three more, cutting directly across the fields, leaving the cows to watch as the horse cantered by, the placid expressions of the bovines at such variance with the utter glee Fee felt at each wall.</p> <p>When the man brought his horse down to a walk at the foot of the drive, she leaned forward and patted the gelding soundly on the shoulder. "Good fellow, Flying Rowan! Oh, that was the best! I will write to everybody and tell them what a good boy you are." She lapsed into the Gaelic, too happy and excited not to praise the horse in a more civilized language than the stilted, stodgy English.</p> <p>Behind her, she felt the man's hard chest shift slightly, and she fell silent.</p> <p>"Mama says it's rude to speak the Gaelic when somebody else can't."</p> <p>"I comprehend it. Is this your home?"</p> <p>"I live here. Aunt Hester lives here too, but Mama and Papa are away right now."</p> <p>"Shall I take you around to the back?"</p> <p>He was scowling at the manor as he spoke, as if the house wasn't the most lovely place in the world, all full of flowers and pretty views.</p> <p>"Here comes Aunt Hester. I expect she'll want to thank you."</p> <p>Fee felt Rowan's owner tense behind her. It wasn't that his muscles bunched up, it was more that he went still. The horse beneath them went still too, as if both man and horse understood that the look on Aunt Hester's face did not at all fit with Fee's prediction of impending thanks.</p> <p>***</p> <p>A female thundercloud was advancing on Tye where he sat his gelding, the little girl perched before him. Beneath his hand, he felt the child's spine stiffen and her bony little shoulders square.</p> <p>This particular thundercloud had golden blond hair piled on top of her head, quite possibly in an attempt to give an illusion of height. She wore an old-fashioned blue walking dress, the dusty hems of which were swishing madly around her boots as she sailed across the drive.</p> <p>He'd always liked the sound of a woman's petticoats in brisk motion, they gave a man a little warning-and something to think about.</p> <p>"I bid you good day." He nodded from the saddle, a hat being a hopeless inconvenience when a man rode cross-country. "Spathfoy, at your service."</p> <p>Some perverse desire to see what she'd do next kept him on the horse, looking down at her from a considerable height.</p> <p>"Hester Daniels." She sketched a hint of a curtsy then planted her fists on her hips. "Fiona Ursula MacGregor, what am I to do with you? Where have you gone off to this time, that a strange man must bring you home at a dead gallop, over field and fence, your hair a fright and-" The lady paused and drew in a tremendous breath. "Why are your boots hanging about your neck? What have I told you about running off barefoot, much less when you're in the company of horses, and when will you remember that we eat meals at regular hours, in a civilized fashion, and what do you expect me to tell your dear mother about this latest escapade?"</p> <p>When she fell silent, Tye was somewhat taken aback to see the lady's eyes shining, quite possibly with tears.</p> <p>"I am sorry," said the girl, hanging her head. "I went to visit the oak, that's all, and it was a fine afternoon for singing in a tree, and then I jumped down, but I landed wrong, and this fellow came along on Flying Rowan. I...</p></p><h2>Hats!: Make Classic Hats and Headpieces in Fabric, Felt, and Straw</h2><p><p>Innovative milliner Sarah Cant takes you step-by-step through the process of creating many types of hats.

Aislinn, who became a faerie in the first book, now has to deal with the awkward--verging on impossible--position of still being in love with her mortal boyfriend Seth, whom she can't even touch without burning. To complicate things further, as the new Summer Queen, Aislinn is eternally bonded to Keenan, the Summer King, and the attraction between them is palpable and constant. In the doomed loves that permeate these books, Marr deftly explores the essence of longing as she questions notions of fated love.

And their situations are rife with conflict, from the impossible mortal-faerie relationships to the ancient familial and courtly spats within the faerie realm.

Smoke is a primer on the most time-tested culinary technique of all&#x2014;but one that we have lost touch with. Chef Tim Byres shows how to imbue all kinds of foods&#x2014;not just meat&#x2014;with the irresistible flavor of smoke. Here he gives innovative ideas for easy ways to use smoke in your everyday kitchen arsenal of flavors&#x2014;such as smoking safely on the stovetop with woodchips, putting together relishes and salsas made with smoked peppers and other vegetables, grilling with wood planks, and using smoke-cured meats to add layers of flavor to a dish. For serious cooks, there are how-to sections on building a firepit, smokehouse, and spit roast at home. As a Texan, Byres draws on the regional traditions of Mexico, Louisiana, and the South. He takes down-home foods and gives them brilliant twists. The results are such gutsy recipes as Pork Jowl Bacon with Half Sour Cucumbers, Boudin Balls and Brick Roux Gumbo, Cabrito and Masa Meatpies, and Coffee-Cured Brisket with Rustic Toast. Everything is made from scratch&#x2014;not just the sausages but also the accompanying sauces, jams, and pickles. This is cooking at its most primal, and delicious.</p><p>Tim Byres is the chef and owner of the restaurants Smoke and Chicken Scratch in Dallas, Texas. Food &amp; Wine named him "Best New Chef of the Southwest" in 2011 and "The People&#x2019;s Best New Chef" in 2012. He has been featured in Southern Living, the New York Times, and Garden &amp; Gun. Josh Ozersky, the author of The Hamburger: A History and Meat Me in Manhattan, has written for Time, Newsday, Saveur, and the New York Times.&#x201c;Tim has given us, in this book, a true sense of journey and experience into the mysteries of the real world of fire, wood, and smoked barbecue with fascinating recipes and tales.&#x201d; ~<i>The Pitmaster Ed Mitchell, Wilson, NC<br></i><br>"Chef Tim Byres gives innovative ideas for easy ways to use smoke in everyday kitchen arsenal of flavors.

Stunning recipes, drop-dead gorgeous photographs, with lively lucid prose to help you to act like you know what you're doing the next time someone thrusts tongs in your hand around a campfire. You can smell the smoke just reading it.&#x201d; ~<i>Steven Raichlen,</i> author of <i>The Barbecue Bible cookbook series</i> and host of<i> Primal Grill on PBS<br><br></i>"....You'll find spice rubs and sauces, alongside grilled pork and smoked oysters. And in the spirit of DIY, in addition to the smoking and canning/preserving instructions, Byres shows you how to make your own hominy, build your own shucking table, and how to build (and cook in) a campfire. The spirit in which he writes is pretty simple: "I wanted to stay true to my food voice, whether the critics got it or not." Byres' food voice has been heard, and it's a fresh and appealing one; it's one worth exploring." ~<i>Epicurious.com<br>&nbsp;<br></i>"Chef Byres&#x2019;s Smoke has been inspirational, providing us with the practical know-how and the motivation we needed to stuff our first fresh chorizo sausage and smoke our first rabbit. Byres�s intelligent, easygoing approach to food makes for delicious reading and eating." ~<i>Matt Lee and Ted Lee,</i> authors,<i> The Lee Bros. Charleston Kitchen<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tim Byres is one of the most skilled and proficient cooks I have ever worked with and only a master of his caliber could bring such a simple but dynamic, new approach to wood cooking.

Ayer in a fabled debate about the existence of God and the possibility of metaphysics, knew that seminary students were fed a woefully inadequate diet of theses and proofs, and that their familiarity with most of history's great thinkers was reduced to simplistic caricatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copleston set out to redress the wrong by writing a complete history of Western Philosophy, one crackling with incident and intellectual excitement - and one that gives full place to each thinker, presenting his thought in a beautifully rounded manner and showing his links to those who went before and to those who came after him.</p><p>Frederick Copleston (1907-1994) grew up in England. He was raised in an Anglican home but converted to Catholicism while a student at Marlborough College. He later became a Jesuit and then pursued a career in academia.

He also spent time teaching at Gregorian University in Rome and, after he retired, lectured at Santa Clara University in California. He was appointed a member of the British Academy in 1970.

However, here is one book which, perhaps more than any other, has influenced its readers to recognize and accept the Scriptural and prophetical teachings concerning the modern Israel of God. Those who are looking for a book sufficiently comprehensive to lay a foundation of essential facts will find here a clear and understandable presentation of the multiple evidences of identification, drawing supporting proof from the Bible and from secular history as well. It is a basic book, which should be in every pastor&#39;s library for ready reference, as well as on the reading list of wide-awake Christian teachers and leaders who desire to understand the distinctions between the various subdivisions of the Race of the Book</p><p></p><h2>Star Trek: Enterprise: Kobayashi Maru</h2><p>To protect the cargo ships essential to the continuing existence of the fledgling Coalition of Planets, the captains of the United Earth's Starfleet are ordered to interstellar picket duty, with little more to do than ask "Who goes there?" into the darkness of space. <p> Captain Jonathan Archer of the <i>Enterprise&#x2122;</i> seethes with frustration, wondering if anyone else can see what he sees. A secret, closed, militaristic society, convinced that their survival hangs by a thread, who view their neighbors as a threat to their very existence -- the Spartans of ancient Greece, the Russians of the old Soviet Union, the Koreans under Kim Il-sung -- with only one goal: attain ultimate power, no matter the cost. The little-known, never-seen Romulans seem to live by these same principles. </p><p> The captain realizes that the bond between the signers of the Coalition charter is fragile and likely to snap if pushed. But he <i>knows</i> that the Romulans are hostile, and he believes they are the force behind the cargo ship attacks. If asked, Archer can offer no proof without endangering his friend's life. </p><p> To whom does he owe his loyalty: his friend, his world, the Coalition? And by choosing one, does he not risk losing all of them? What is the solution to a no-win scenario?</p></p><p><b>Michael A.

You're already at least as bored with this mission as I am."</i> </p><p> Unable to deny his fellow NX-class starship captain's assertion, Captain Jonathan Archer smoothed his rumpled uniform and leaned back in his chair with a resigned sigh. Porthos, whom Archer had thought was fast asleep behind him at the foot of his bed, released a short but portentous bark, as if voicing agreement with the woman who looked on expectantly from the screen. Archer turned away from the lone desktop terminal in his quarters just long enough to toss a small dog treat to the beagle, who immediately became far too preoccupied with the noisy business of eating to tender any further opinions. </p><p> "My feelings really don't matter all that much, Erika," Archer said to the image on the terminal. "And frankly, neither do yours. This was Starfleet's call to make, not ours." </p><p> From across the nearly six-parsec-wide gulf of interstellar space that currently separated <i>Enterprise</i> from <i>Columbia,</i> Captain Erika Hernandez punctuated her reply with a withering frown. <i>"All right. Who are you, and what have you done with Jon Archer?"</i> </p><p> His lips curled in an inadvertent grin. "I'm just an explorer, Erika. I don't make policy. And I don't like babysitting Earth Cargo Service freighter convoys any more than you do. But you've got to admit that there <i>have</i> been enough attacks on the main civilian shipping lanes over the past few weeks to justify keeping Earth's two fastest and best-armed starships out on continuous patrol, at least for a while." </p><p> She shook her head slightly. <i>"Maybe. But not indefinitely. And certainly not if you're interested in treating the underlying disease instead of just the symptoms."</i> </p><p> Archer couldn't really disagree with that either. The past six weeks of mostly uneventful patrol duty, spent endlessly covering the same roughly twenty-light-year stretches outbound from Earth, followed by a virtually identical inbound course which intermittently brought <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Columbia</i> together from opposite directions, put him in mind of the ancient Greek myth about a man whose misdeeds had earned him the divine punishment of rolling a huge boulder up a hill, only to have to repeat the process endlessly after reaching the summit and seeing it roll down again. Archer sometimes half-seriously considered asking Starfleet to send the new <i>NX</i>-class starship <i>Challenger,</i> still under construction in the skies above San Francisco, to relieve him -- after rechristening it <i>Sisyphus,</i> of course. </p><p> But he knew better than to think that either he or Captain Hernandez could do much to change the minds of Admirals Gardner, Black, Douglas, Clark, Palmieri, or any of the rest of Starfleet Command's determined brass hats. After all, each of them had shot down essentially the same argument Erika was making today when Archer had first brought the topic before them weeks ago. </p><p> "We still don't have any hard proof that the attacks against our freighters are anything other than exactly what they appear to be," Archer said. "The work of rogue pirates and freebooters." </p><p> <i>"That's probably only because those alleged 'rogue pirates and freebooters' have been keeping us both so busy waiting and watching, not to mention wearing a triangular groove in the space between Earth and Draylax and Deneva, that we haven't had any time to go hunt down the real culprits."</i> </p><p> "The Romulans," Archer said. </p><p> She nodded, confirming that he had completed her unvoiced thought. <i>"Or the Klingons. Or maybe even both. The disruptor traces we found on the hull debris are consistent with either of them."</i> </p><p> "As nasty as the Klingons can be, my money's on the Romulans," Archer said. </p><p> Her eyes widened. <i>"Why? You know something I don't?"</i> </p><p> He nodded. "Is this line secure on your end?" </p><p> <i>"I trust my mother and God, in that order,"</i> she said with a nod of her own. <i>"Everybody and everything else has to go through the most stringent of security protocols. Go ahead."</i> </p><p> He paused to gather his thoughts. From the edge of the bed, Porthos released a low growl that almost made Archer wonder if his own dog wasn't spying on him on behalf of Admiral Gardner. </p><p> "The attack on Coridan has overshadowed just about everything else that's been going on in a dozen sectors in every direction," Archer said at length. </p><p> <i>"That's understandable. Over a billion people have died on Coridan Prime so far, and people are still dying there three months later thanks to all the environmental damage, not to mention the damned civil war they're fighting. Have you found some evidence linking the Romulans to the Coridan attack?"</i> </p><p> "No," he said with a glum shake of his head. "The Romulans are way too subtle to leave any fingerprints behind." </p><p> She frowned again. <i>"So why bring up Coridan?"</i> </p><p> "Because Starfleet has been able to use it as a diversion to keep a lid on something we discovered on Andoria a little bit before the Coridan attack. The admiralty has classified my report on the subject. But in my judgment you have a legitimate need to know what they've been sitting on these past few months." </p><p> Hernandez's brow furrowed. <i>"You've found evidence of some sort of Romulan incursion on Andoria?"</i> </p><p> "Indirect evidence. But it's as close to a smoking gun as you're going to get with people as slick as the Romulans. You've been briefed about their use of telepaths to pilot remote-controlled attack ships, right?" </p><p> <i>"Of course. I know that you and your crew destroyed a telepath-guided Romulan prototype last year."</i> </p><p> "Right. But what you <i>haven't</i> been told is that the Romulans have recently been trying to get their hands on more telepaths for similar military applications, using the services of third parties brokered through Adigeon Prime." </p><p> A look of understanding crossed her olive features. <i>"The Adigeons. Gotta love those tight-lipped Swiss banker types."</i> </p><p> "Believe me, the Adigeons make the old Swiss bankers look like the village gossip. In spite of that, we managed to track down and rescue about three dozen Aenar-Andorian telepaths that a third party had captured on behalf of the Romulans." </p><p> Hernandez's face became a study in horror. <i>"Enslaving all those people. Just to launch another remote-control attack against us."</i> </p><p> "And they're not going to back off, either. Not when they can just lie in the weeds and wait until they're ready to try again." </p><p> The horror on Hernandez's countenance slowly solidified into an almost palpable anger, and her words carried the timbre of blood and fire. <i>"And you're content to let Starfleet just go on reacting instead of actually doing something?"</i> </p><p> Archer endured her not-so-subtle criticism with all the stoicism he could muster. "What makes you think I'm not doing anything?" </p><p> <i>"Let's see. Maybe it's the fact that you're still out here patrolling the boonies, just like I am."</i> </p><p> "Let's just say I'm working on the problem through a back channel and leave it at that." </p><p> <i>"I know you have political pull that I don't, since you're the man who saved Earth from the Xindi. But I can't believe you've got a special back channel with Starfleet Command that I don't even</i> know <i>about."</i> </p><p> Archer grinned. "What makes you think I was talking about Starfleet Command? Their hands are full at the moment just keeping the Coalition from collapsing into four squabbling pieces, especially since the Coridan attack." </p><p> <i>"Unlike either of us,"</i> Hernandez said as the door chime sounded. </p><p> "Be careful what you wish for, Erika," Archer said, even though he was half hoping for news of another so-called pirate raid, if only to break up the tedium of the past several days of utterly fruitless patrolling. He held up a hand for silence, then turned toward the door. </p><p> "Come." </p><p> The door hissed open and Commander T'Pol stepped gingerly over the slightly raised threshold, then paused in the open hatchway. She wore a standard-issue, dark blue Starfleet duty uniform, a sight to which he was still only beginning to become accustomed, though she had adopted it nearly three months ago. To the Vulcan woman's credit, she appeared as comfortable and unself-conscious wearing Earth's service attire as she had in the somewhat more formfitting uniform of the Vulcan military from which she had retired over a year earlier. Despite the lateness of the hour, her clothing looked fresh and neatly pressed. </p><p> "I apologize for disturbing you, Captain, but I have received some news that you will wish to hear immediately," she said, still hesitating in the open hatchway. She glanced toward the image of Captain Hernandez, which was clearly visible from her vantage point. "Am I interrupting anything?" </p><p> Archer smiled gently at his second-in-command. Long before their respective careers had conspired to draw them literally light-years apart, there had once been a time when anyone "walking in" on him and Erika Hernandez might indeed have interrupted something rather intimate. Had Hernandez, who had never been sanguine about making love in Porthos's presence -- and was allergic to pet dander to boot -- not issued a fateful <i>it's-me-or-the-beagle</i> ultimatum, the lives and careers of both captains might have taken radically different trajectories. Only very rarely, such as that time his canine companion had become fragrantly flatulent after snarfing up an entire wheel of Chef's fancy Gruy�re cheese, did the captain have cause to regret his decision. Regardless, fair was fair, and since he'd known Porthos longer than he'd known Hernandez, the dog had ultimately won the contest. </p><p> Remaining in his chair, Archer fanned the fingers of his left hand toward himself in a "come in" gesture. "Not at all, Commander. I'm sure you know Captain Hernandez." </p><p> T'Pol finished crossing the threshold and allowed the hatch to hiss closed behind her just as Porthos jumped...</p></p><h2>Losing My Virginity: How I&#39;ve Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way</h2><p><b>"Oh, screw it, let's do it."</b><br><br>That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br><br>Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that "since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin." Since then, Branson has written his own "rules" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br><br>Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition.

But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br>And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br><br> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br><br>Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br><br>Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br><br>Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br><br>Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br><br>Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br><br>And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.<br><br><b>Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing,</b><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>In this autobiography, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson says one of his prime business criteria is "fun." Fun made Branson a billionaire, and few business memoirs are one-billionth as fun as Branson's, nor as niftily written. Not only does it relate his side of near-death corporate experiences, it tells how the chairman literally cheated death by gun, shipwreck, and balloon crash.<p> Branson's empire--now encompassing interests in an airline, pop music, soda pop, e-commerce, and financial services--began when the dyslexic 16-year-old dropped out of school in 1968 to found the British magazine <i>Student</i>. His headmaster said, "I predict that you will either go to prison or become a millionaire." Briefly imprisoned for dodging customs selling records, Branson got his first million by releasing <i>Tubular Bells</i>, a maverick recording all the stuffy executives rejected. (1998's <i>Tubular Bells III</i> puts the series' sales over 20 million.) </p><p> Despite wild tales of Branson's wife-swapping and Keith Richards fleeing naked from Branson's studio at gunpoint with another man's woman, the most shocking parts of the memoir concern British Airways' James Bond-like "dirty tricks" campaign against Virgin Atlantic, resulting in the biggest award for damages in English history.</p><p> Though it's filled with famous names, witty quotes, and pulse-pounding accounts of lunatic balloon adventures, it is as a business thriller that the book really scores. His instinctive bet-the-ranch tactics could cost him all, or earn another billion. Either way, Branson will likely remain the most entertaining entrepreneur in Europe. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>What they're saying about Richard Branson:<br><br>"Richard is good-looking and very smart, which is sexy to start with.

Frederick II of Prussia attempted to escape his authoritarian father as a boy, but went on to become one of history&#39;s greatest rulers. He loved the flute, and devoted hours of study to the arts and French literature, forming a long-lasting but turbulent friendship with Voltaire. He was a military genius and enlarged the borders of his empire, but he also promoted religious tolerance, economic reform and laid the foundation for a united Germany. Nancy Mitford brings all these contradictions and achievements to sparkling life in an fascinating, intimate biography.</p><p>Nancy Mitford (1904-1973) was born into the British aristocracy and, by her own account, brought up without an education, except in riding and French.

Mitford was also the author of four biographies: &#34;Madame de Pompadour&#34; (1954), &#34;Voltaire in Love&#34; (1957), &#34;The Sun King&#34; (1966), and&#34; Frederick the Great &#34;(1970)--all available as NYRB classics.

One of the men killed was Captain Reynaud, beloved brother of widowed Lady Emeline Gordon. Since this respected society matron also chaperones society's young maidens, Samuel contrives to meet her by asking her help in preparing his sister Rebecca to enter London society. The very model of propriety, and engaged to the titled Lord Vale whom she has known since childhood (and who also fought in the ill-fated battle) Lady Emeline is drawn to Samuel's rough vigor, not realizing the demons possessing him. Hoyt parallels the fast-paced tension in Sam's search with growing romantic tension, occasionally lightened by interludes involving Emeline's young son, Daniel; a tart French aunt; and Samuel's own sister. A nail-biting finale creates a satisfying denouement. Hoyt (<i>The Raven Prince</i>, etc.) is firmly in control of her craft with engaging characters, gripping plot and clever dialogue. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But if it eats the Principal, there are two possibilities..."). A subversive and satisfying take on "What if . . . ?" illustrated in bright pick-me-up colors, When a Monster is Born will have readers imagining unlikely stories of their own--and laughing out loud.</p></p><p><p>Sean Taylor is a graduate of Cambridge University and has worked as a publisher, journalist, and teacher.

He lives in London.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;Fittingly, this book's large size, dramatic black backgrounds, and bold colors leap off the page at readers, just like a monster jumping out of a closet. Based on a traditional Brazilian poem, the story looks at the many possibilities created by the birth of a monster: "either it's a faraway-in-the-forests monster, or...it's an under-your-bed monster." For each set of choices there is a dead-end option ("If it eats you, that's that."), and an option that leads to two more possibilities. Following a series of wild twists, in which a principal is eaten and a kitchen girl dumps porridge on a monster's head, the tale comes full circle to the birth of a new monster and the original set of possibilities. Bright colors and a wild variety of fonts burst out from each page, and the potential scariness of the monster is tempered by its round body, buck teeth, and fuzzy hair. Various colors, textured fabrics, and other materials fill in the cartoon line drawings. Tiny leaves create the bushes and grass, the monster's hair is full of swirls, and the porridge contains lumps. With its zany humor, skillful timing of page turns, and over-the-top story line, this is an engaging tale that children will respond to and request again and again.&#x2014;<i>Suzanne Myers Harold, Multnomah County Library System, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was a sullen endeavour for Thermopylae&#x2019;s people, for the Dutch had not much of a fleet left since the Battle of Camperdown, four years before, in 1797, when Adm. Duncan had caught them, headed for the English Channel to combine with their French masters&#x2019; fleet for an invasion of Great Britain, had forced them to run for home close inshore of their own coast, where Duncan had given them the choice of wrecking on their own shoals or fighting, and had taken, sunk, or burned almost all of them. By now, the few surviving Batavian warships&nbsp; were slowly rotting away at their moorings, their new construction rotting on the stocks, and all their vaunting plans for a larger fleet scrapped. <br>Sullen, too, was the general attitude aboard Thermopylae after months of dull blockade duty, for it could not hold a candle to the heady and dar�ing adventures of the first of the year of 1801. As the League of Armed Neutrality had readied their navies to confront the Royal Navy, it had been Thermopylae that had been ordered into the Baltic&#x2014;alone!&#x2014;to &#x201c;smoak out&#x201d; the types and numbers of ships being prepared in Danish, Swedish, and Russian harbours, to determine the thickness of the ice that kept all Baltic navies penned in port, and to ascertain how long it would be before the ice would melt and free them. <br>Oh, there&#x2019;d also been the delivery of a pair of Russian nobles to some�where as close as possible to St. Petersburg . . . one of whom had tried to kill their new captain as they&nbsp; were being set ashore, an attempted murder right by the entry-port . . . all over a London whore, of all things! . . . And for certain the younger Roosky was love-sick mad, but what could be expected of foreigners, and&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t their new captain a scrapper, thought <br>Out of the Baltic at last, and there&#x2019;d been their own British Expedition�ary squadrons under Vice- Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and Vice- Admiral Horatio Nelson, and they&#x2019;d been just in time to take part in the glorious Battle of Copenhagen and squash the Danes like so many roaches round the galley butter tubs! <br>All downhill from there, though; first cruising in the Baltic &#x2019;til mid�summer, watching first Vice- Admiral Parker go home (in a bit of dis�grace, the hands had heard-tell) then Nelson departing for his always fragile health, and, at last, a spell of re-victualling and repairs at Great Yarmouth, where the adventures had begun, and a spell of shore liberty. After that, Thermopylae had been seconded to the small North Sea Fleet to serve as a scout, doing much of a boresome much as they did this morning . . . making her presence known under reduced sail about two leagues seaward of the shoals, and counting windmills, for all they good &#x201c;people&#x201d; Thermo�pylae of &#x201c;people&#x201d; knew. <br>In a thin and fine mist on this particular morning, a cold early-October rain was falling and dripping in great dollops from sails and rigging, over a grey and dingy-white-foamed sea that chopped and hissed and imparted to the frigate a slow and queasy wallowing roll. And the wind . . . if freed, Thermopylae could cup that wind and rush like a Cambridge coach, high on eleven knots or better . . . yet that wind was wasted on her twice-reefed or gathered sails. And it was a nippy wind, to boot, a raw-un out of the Nor&#x2019;west, fresh from Arctic ice sheets that made nettled tars wish for their Franklin-pattern stoves to be set up on the gun-deck once again, blow warm breaths into cupped fists, and shiver under their tarred tarpau�lins. <br>HMS Thermopylae&#x2019;s Second Officer, Lt. James Fox, let out a pleased sigh as a ship&#x2019;s boy turned the half-hour glass, then slowly struck Eight Bells up by the forecastle. His watch was done, and hot tea or coff ee awaited him in the gun-room below, along with his breakfast. Lt. Fox clapped gloved hands together in joy as his replacement, his old chum Lt. Dick Farley, stepped from the lee side of the quarterdeck to amidships before the double- helm drum and the binnacle cabinet to assume command of the Forenoon Watch. <br>&#x201c;A thouroughly miserable day, and I wish ye joy of it, Dick,&#x201d; Lt. Fox said with a grin and a roll of his eyes. <br>&#x201c;Worse things happen at sea, Jemmy,&#x201d; Lt. Farley replied as he for�mally doff ed his hat, a second-best and much-battered old thing with its gilt lace gone verdigris green. Fox&#x2019;s&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t a whit better. <br>&#x201c;Just thinking that, in point of fact,&#x201d; Lt. Fox quipped. &#x201c;So, the usual . . . wind&#x2019;s still Nor&#x2019;westerly,&nbsp; we&#x2019;re beam- reaching, as anyone can clearly see, course Nor&#x2019;East, half East, and making six agonisingly slow knots. What&#x2019;s for breakfast?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Scrambled eggs, cheese, and biscuit, speaking of usual,&#x201d; Lt. Farley replied. &#x201c;Has the captain determined whether we&#x2019;ll exercise at the great-guns this morning?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t said yet,&#x201d; Lt. Fox replied, letting a yawn escape him. &#x201c;Damme, I was hoping for hot porridge. Do we drill on the artillery, I&#x2019;d prefer a steadier point of sail.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye, this roll&#x2019;d be a bugger,&#x201d; Lt. Farley agreed. <br>&#x201c;Well, I leave you to it, Dick,&#x201d; Fox said, cheering up. <br>&#x201c;I relieve you, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley said with another doff of his hat, and the Second Officer, along with his Midshipmen of the Watch, and the Starboard Watch of the quarterdeck and Afterguard,&nbsp; were scrambling below, some to their breakfasts, some to the uncertain warmth of the gun- deck. <br>Right aft, and just below the quarterdeck in the great-cabins, Captain Alan Lewrie was shaving . . . or trying to. It was not a chore comfortably, or safely, done in such a wallowing, rolling sea-way, in the small mirror of his wash- hand stand with a straight razor. Lewrie had to brace himself like a runner frozen in mid-stride, his left leg behind him and his right in front, balancing from one to the other as Thermopylae heaved from beam to beam like a metronome, about fifteen degrees or better to each roll. He could have sat himself down in a chair, but would be without the mirror, or the small enamelled basin that held his single pint of water ration for washing daily. <br>&#x201c;Get out of it, ye bloody little. . . . !&#x201d; Lewrie snapped as Chalky, the younger and spryer of his cats, leaped atop the wash- hand stand for the third time, fascinated in equal measure by the lapping water in the basin <br>and his reflection in the mirror. &#x201c;Shoo! Scat! Pettus!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; his cabin steward replied, carefully hiding his smile. <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there some amusement ye could offer him?&#x201d; Lewrie griped. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him, sir,&#x201d; Pettus off ered, coming to scoop up the white and grey-splotched cat and bear him away, spraddled atop his forearm. An instant later, and it was Toulon, the bigger and older (and clumsier) black�and-white tom that wished to see what had taken Chalky&#x2019;s attention, but his leap was just a tad off (blame it on the roll) and he went tumbling back to the deck, with the hand towel in his paws. Mrrf! he carped, tail bottled up in disgrace. Then Marr! as he looked up plaintively at Lewrie, as if to ask if he&#x2019;d seen that flub. <br>&#x201c;I still love ye t&#x2019;death, Toulon,&#x201d; Lewrie commiserated, bending down to retrieve the hand towel and give the embarrassed cat a &#x201c;wubbie&#x201d; or two. He had to grin, for there had been scraped-off&nbsp; shaving soap on the towel, and Toulon had gotten some of it on his whis kers, which made him go slightly cross-eyed trying to see it and swipe it off , sitting up rabbit- fashion and whacking away with both paws. <br>Thermopylae rose up to a rare scending wave and heaved another slow roll to starboard, timbers, masts and windward stays groaning in concert, and Lewrie half- staggered almost to amidships before catching himself. &#x201c;Mine arse on a band-box!&#x201d; he hissed under his breath, using one of his favourite expressions. That stagger involved some complicated foot stamp�ing, which only drove the cat under the starboard-side settee, into relative darkness where Toulon could blink in shame and in umbrage, consulting his cat gods. <br>The larboard roll took Lewrie back to the wash-hand stand, where he took a firm grip with one hand and braced himself for another stab at shaving. <br>&#x201c;Um . . . might you need me to do it for you, sir?&#x201d; Pettus asked. <br>&#x201c;No no, Pettus!&#x201d; Lewrie countered with a false grin on his phyz, &#x201c;Done for meself for years, in worse weather than this. Dined out on my dexterity!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you say so, sir,&#x201d; Pettus replied with a dubious expression. <br>Once he&#x2019;d scraped his whis kers as close as he dared, without cutting his own throat, Lewrie swabbed his face, tied his neck-stock, and donned his uniform coat. He made a careful way forrud to the dining-coach and his table, and his breakfast. <br>It was a Banyan Day, without any salt- meat issue, and after a miserable two months on blockade, a paltry and dull breakfast it was. There was oatmeal porridge, boiled up in water, not milk, and livened with a daub of rancid butter and a largish dollop of strawberry preserves. There was a slab of cheese from his own stores, not that crumbling, dry-as-sawdust Navy issue so beloved of the Victualling Board, but even that was begin�ning to go over, though showed no signs of red worms yet. And there was ship&#x2019;s biscuit. Lewrie had purchased extra-fine for himself, but it was tough going, even after being soaked in water for the better part of an hour before being served, and, did he wish to keep his remaining teeth, he&#x2019;d chew it hellish-careful. There was coffee, at least, with sugar grated off a cone from his locking caddy, and sweet goat&#x2019;s milk from the nanny up forrud in the manger. <br>Lewrie turned his eyes towards the cats&#x2019; dish at the far end of his table, where a reassured Toulon and a cocky Chalky&nbsp; were having their own porridge, laced with cut-up sausages and jerkied beef, and felt a trifle en�vious! <br>With his second piping- hot cup of coffee, Lewrie considered one more biscuit, and peered into the bread barge . . . just in time to see the weevils crawling out of the last piece. No thankee! he thought. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be on deck, Pettus,&#x201d; Lewrie said, shoving back from his plate and rising. &#x201c;Shove me into my boat-cloak, and I&#x2019;m off .&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Captain&#x2019;s on deck!&#x201d; Midshipman Tillyard announced to one and all as Lewrie trotted up the larboard gangway ladder from the waist. &#x201c;Morning, sir,&#x201d; Tillyard added, with a hand to his hat. <br>&#x201c;And a dull&#x2019;un, Mister Tillyard,&#x201d; Lewrie replied, his own right hand touching the front of his cocked hat. &#x201c;Good morning to you, Mister Far-ley. Anything of interest to report?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Captain. No, nothing of interest so far, sorry to say,&#x201d; the First Officer told him. Lewrie began to pace the windward side of the quarterdeck, with Farley in-board of him. &#x201c;The mast- head lookouts have reported seeing some of those canal barges under sail behind the dikes, every now and then, but I&nbsp; can&#x2019;t imagine a way to get at them, not through those shoals, yonder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Seemed an organised sort o&#x2019; thing?&#x201d; Lewrie asked. &#x201c;Or merely a ci�vilian barge or two?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve gathered they&#x2019;re singletons, sir, swanning along slowly in both directions,&#x201d; Lt. Farley said in answer as they reached the flag lockers and taffrail lanthorns right aft, forcing them both to turn inwards and reverse their course. &#x201c;One or two with washing strung up, and women aboard, and not more than two of those could be described as being close to�gether.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dull as Dutchmen,&#x201d; Lewrie decided aloud, with a sigh. <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley agreed. <br>&#x201c;Dead-boresome,&#x201d; Lewrie said further. <br>&#x201c;Indeed, sir,&#x201d; Farley said with a nod. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so bored,&#x201d; Lewrie admitted. &#x201c;A cutter could perform this duty better. A frigate&#x2019;s wasted on close blockade.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I fear we all are, sir. Bored, that is,&#x201d; Farley told him. &#x201c;Ah, about drill on the great-guns, sir . . .&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not with this bloody rolling, Mister Farley. Not today. We&#x2019;d be safer at pike and cutlass work. And musketry, aye!&#x201d; Lewrie said in suddenly brighter takings. &#x201c;One hour o&#x2019; cut an&#x2019; thrust, then an hour o&#x2019; musketry at a towed keg.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Very good, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley said with a relieved grin. <br>&#x201c;Deck, there!&#x201d; a lookout on the main- mast cross-trees shouted down. &#x201c;Cutter off th&#x2019; larboard quarter, hull up, an&#x2019; makin&#x2019; signal!&#x201d; <br>No more&#x2019;n eight or nine miles off, Lewrie decided to himself as he turned to peer to windward. Even from the deck, he could faintly make out a dingy white triangle of sail&#x2014;a set of triangular jibs and a gaff - rigged fore- and-aft mains&#x2019;l barely peeking from behind the jibs&#x2014; with a tiny splotch of colour at her mast- head that presumably was a national ensign. Perhaps the lookout had better eyes to espy the even tinier signal hoist from so far away. <br>&#x201c;Aloft with you, Mister Pannabaker,&#x201d; Lt. Farley ordered one of the younger Midshipmen of the Forenoon Watch, &#x201c;and mind you don&#x2019;t drop the glass.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye, sir!&#x201d; young Pannabaker, Thermopylae&#x2019;s cockiest &#x201c;younker,&#x201d; piped up in reply, scrambling for a long telescope, then hopping atop the weather bulwarks for the mizer-mast shrouds. Quick as a cat, and as agile as an ape, he was at the mizen top, then to its cross-trees in a dozen eye-blinks. <br>&#x201c;Come to spell us, one&#x2019;d hope,&#x201d; Lewrie said with a yawn, rocking impatiently on the balls of his booted feet. <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the Osprey, sir!&#x201d; Pannabaker shouted down in his thin and high voice. &#x201c;This month&#x2019;s private signal, and &#x2018;Have Despatches,&#x2019; sir!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Mister Tillyard, do you hoist &#x2018;Acknowledged&#x2019; to Osprey, and I s&#x2019;pose we&#x2019;ll just loaf along . . . as we&#x2019;re already doing . . .&#x2019;til she&#x2019;s close aboard.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye aye, sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hmm, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley commented, drawing Lewrie&#x2019;s attention to his First Lieutenant, whose face bore a pensive, wolfish grin. It was not the done thing to speculate, but . . . <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d not get my hopes up, Mister Farley,&#x201d; Lewrie had to say to him. &#x201c;The Baltic powers&#x2019;ve had quite enough of us. . . . The Dutch&nbsp; can&#x2019;t put a rowing boat regatta to sea . . . and, are the French out, I doubt they&#x2019;ve business in the North Sea. One&#x2019;d wish, but . . . ,&#x201d; he concluded with a shrug. <br>&#x201c;They also serve, who only stand and wait, I suppose, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley replied, seeming to slump into his tarpaulin coat. <br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Lewrie said with a very bored grimace. <br>Excerpted from King, Ship, and Sword by Dewey Lambdin.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Dewey Lambdin. <br>Published in January 2010 by St. Marin's Press.<br>All rights reserved.

He wanted particularly to visit the Georgian mountain tribes - Tush, Khevsurs, Ratchuelians and Svans - to discover if they shared a common mountain culture, and to test the old idea of the Caucasus as an impenetrable barrier from sea to sea. From Azerbaijan to Svaneti, Anderson found communities where the old customs and beliefs still triumphantly survive, despite years of Communist oppression and the terrible uncertainties since the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br><br>Throughout his journey Anderson refers back to many other visits to Georgia, to the politics of independence, to the war in Abkhazia and Ossetia, to the civil war and Shevardnadze's accession to power, to the history of these people at one of the great crossroads of the world. It remains an abiding mystery that Georgia has managed to survive at all, devastated time and again by the vagabond hordes from the steppes and torn between the mighty empires that struggled over it. But survive it has with a vibrant culture still intact and, in the mountains, still deeply connected to its ancient ways.</p><p></p><h2>Endgame: Bobby Fischer&#39;s Remarkable Rise and Fall - from America&#39;s Brightest Prodigy to the Edge of Madness</h2><p><i>Endgame </i>is acclaimed biographer Frank Brady&#x2019;s decades-in-the-making tracing of the meteoric ascent&#x2014;and confounding <i>descent</i>&#x2014;of enigmatic genius Bobby Fischer.&nbsp; Only Brady, who met Fischer when the prodigy was only 10 and shared with him some of his most dramatic triumphs, could have written this book, which has much to say about the nature of American celebrity and the distorting effects of fame.&nbsp; Drawing from Fischer family archives, recently released FBI files, and Bobby&#x2019;s own emails, this account is unique in that it limns Fischer&#x2019;s <i>entire</i> life&#x2014;an odyssey that took the Brooklyn-raised chess champion from an impoverished childhood to the covers of <i>Time, Life </i>and <i>Newsweek </i>to recognition as &#x201c;the most famous man in the world&#x201d; to notorious recluse.<br>&nbsp;<br>At first all one noticed was how gifted Fischer was.&nbsp; Possessing a 181 I.Q. and remarkable powers of concentration, Bobby memorized<i> </i>hundreds of chess books in several languages, and he was only 13 when he became the youngest chess master in U.S. history.&nbsp;&nbsp; But his strange behavior started early.&nbsp; In 1972, at the historic Cold War showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he faced Soviet champion Boris Spassky, Fischer made headlines with hundreds of petty demands that nearly ended the competition. <br>&nbsp;<br>It was merely a prelude to what was to come.<br>&nbsp;<br>Arriving back in the United States to a hero&#x2019;s welcome, Bobby was mobbed wherever he went&#x2014;a figure as exotic and improbable as any American pop culture had yet produced.&nbsp; No player of a mere &#x201c;board game&#x201d; had ever ascended to such heights.&nbsp; Commercial sponsorship offers poured in, ultimately topping $10 million&#x2014;but Bobby demurred.&nbsp; Instead, he began tithing his limited money to an apocalyptic religion and devouring anti-Semitic literature.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>After years of poverty and a stint living on Los Angeles&#x2019; Skid Row, Bobby remerged in 1992 to play Spassky in a multi-million dollar rematch&#x2014;but the experience only <i>deepened </i>a paranoia that had formed years earlier when he came to believe that the Soviets wanted him dead for taking away &#x201c;their&#x201d; title.&nbsp; When the dust settled, Bobby was a wanted man&#x2014;transformed into an international fugitive because of his decision to play in Montenegro despite U.S. sanctions.&nbsp; Fearing for his life, traveling with bodyguards, and wearing a long leather coat to ward off knife attacks, Bobby lived the life of a celebrity fugitive &#x2013; one drawn increasingly to the bizarre.&nbsp; Mafiosi, Nazis, odd attempts to breed an heir who could perpetuate his chess-genius DNA&#x2014;all are woven into his late-life tapestry. <br>&nbsp;<br>And yet, as Brady shows, the most notable irony of Bobby Fischer&#x2019;s strange descent &#x2013; which had reached full plummet by 2005 when he turned down yet <i>another </i>multi-million dollar payday&#x2014;is that despite his incomprehensible behavior, there were many who remained fiercely loyal to him.&nbsp; Why that was so is at least partly the subject of this book&#x2014;one that at last answers the question: &#x201c;Who <i>was </i>Bobby Fischer?&#x201d;</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011</strong>: There may be no one more qualified than Frank Brady to write the definitive biography of Bobby Fischer. Brady's <em>Profile of a Prodigy</em> (originally published in 1969) chronicled the chess icon's early years, a selection of 90 games, and (in later editions) his 1972 World Championship match with Boris Spassky. With <em>Endgame</em>, published two years after Fischer's death, Brady's on-and-off proximity to Fischer lends new depth to the latter's full and twisted life story. Though Fischer's pinnacle artistry on the chessboard may often be discussed in the same breath with his eventual paranoia and outspoken anti-Semitism, the particular turns and travels of his post-World Championship years (half his life) lend his story most of its vexing oddity: the niggling insistence on seemingly arbitrary conditions for his matches, the years on the lam after flagrantly disregarding U.S. economic sanctions, his incarceration in Japan, his eventual citizenship and quiet demise in Iceland. All told, Fischer's life was like none other, and told through the lens of Brady's personal familiarity and access to new source material, results in an utterly engaging read. --<em>Jason Kirk</em> <br> <br> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Dick Cavett</strong> <br> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Dick Cavett</strong> is the host of &#x201c;The Dick Cavett Show&#x201d;---which aired on ABC from 1968 to 1975 and on public television from 1977 to 1982---Dick Cavett is the author, most recently, of <em>Talk Show: Confrontations, Pointed Commentary, and Off-Screen Secrets</em>.

Poor Bobby was blessed and cursed by his genius, and his story has the arc of a Greek tragedy---with a grim touch of mad King Lear at the end.</p> <p>The brain power and concentrated days and nights Bobby spent studying the game left much of him undeveloped, unable to join conversations on other subjects. Later in his life, unhappy with his limited knowledge of things beyond the chess board, he compensated with massive study---applying that same hard-butt dedication to other fields: politics, classics, religion, philosophy and more. He found a hide-away nook in a Reykjavic bookstore---barred from his homeland, Iceland had welcomed him back---where he read in marathon sessions. (After he was recognized, he never went back to his cozy cul de sac.)</p> <p>In Brady&#x2019;s telling the high drama of the Spassky match quickens the pulse; the contest that made America a chess-crazed land was seen by more people than the Superbowl. People skipped school and played sick in vast numbers, glued to watching Shelby Lyman explain what was happening. The fanaticism was worldwide. The match was seen as a Cold War event, with the time out of mind chess-ruling Russian bear vanquished.</p> <p>Arguably the best known man on the planet at his triumphant peak, Bobby is later seen in this account riding buses in Los Angeles, able to pay his rent in a dump of an apartment only because his mother sent him her social-security checks.

He said it was the moment when you &#x201c;break the other guy&#x2019;s ego.&#x201d; There was a shocked murmur from the audience and the quote went around the world.</p> <p>Frank Brady&#x2019;s <em>Endgame </em>is one of those books that makes you want your dinner guests to go the hell home so you can get back to it.</p> <p></p><b>FRANK BRADY</b> is internationally recognized as the person most knowledgeable about the life and career of Bobby Fischer.&nbsp; Brady is the author of numerous critically acclaimed biographies, including <i>Citizen Welles; Onassis: An Extravagant Life; </i>and <i>Bobby Fischer: Profile of a Prodigy </i>(the first edition of which appeared in the mid-1960&#x2019;s and focuses on the young Bobby).&nbsp; Until recently, Brady was the Chairman of the Communications Department at St. John&#x2019;s University, and he remains a full professor there.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is also the President of the Marshall Chess Club and was the founding editor of <i>Chess Life.</i></p><h2>Fundamentals of Building a Bamboo Fly-Rod</h2><p><p><strong>Inspired by the teachings of a master rodmaker, here is a step-by-step guide to the craft of building handmade, heirloom-quality bamboo fly-rods&#x2015;the most coveted of all rods.</strong></p> Spurred in part by a quest for something authentic in a mostly synthetic world, more and more anglers are abandoning high-tech graphite fly-rods in favor of those hand-crafted from bamboo.

In easy to understand language, supported by clear photographs and graphic demonstrations, this book covers all of the important subjects-including what gold is and looks like, where it comes from and where to find it, how gold deposits and how to find and recover it, and also touches on the legal aspects of how to claim the gold for yourself. The book covers up-to-date mining procedures of panning gold, sluicing, dredging, high banking, drywashing, electronic probing, hardrock mining, basic refining techniques, cleaning procedures, selling gold, and much, much more. Herein lies the most comprehensive and thorough work on electronic prospecting techniques (locating gold with metal detectors) available in a publication on the market today. Virtually an encyclopedia of modern gold mining techniques, there is no other book available more up to date, more simple to understand, or which covers the entire subject as thoroughly as this manual.</p><p>About the author, Dave McCracken. By Marcie Foley After high school, in 1973, Dave joined the Navy, and graduated UDT/SEAL training class 77 in San Diego, California. He graduated as one of only seven men, from a beginning-class of 57 enrollees. Dave spent four years in the Navy, stationed in Coronado, San Diego with the UDT/SEAL teams. He made one tour to Vietnam/Westpac. At the end of his 4-year tour Dave moved to Los Angeles and started a commercial diving business, mostly performing underwater maintenance on yachts. Gold prices were going up dramatically during late 1979, and Dave began to consider that he might be able to use his diving ability and experience to recover gold from the bottom of California s rivers. He discovered (through a magazine) that people were already using suction dredges, so Dave made a trip to Keene Engineering (in Northridge, California) to discover an entire product-line of underwater mining equipment. In 1979, Dave launched his first expedition with two friends. They started in southern Oregon, and ended up in northern California 6 weeks later. After reading all of the available literature on underwater mining, they found the information was not much more than instructions on how to assemble the equipment. Dave and his partners had a very difficult time of it in the beginning, trying to figure out by themselves workable methods of locating gold deposits. It was several months of severe hardship before Dave and his partners located their first commercial-grade gold deposit (about $60 a day), which was enough to pay expenses and feed them. Dave s partners lost interest before the spring-thaw, and departed with the dredge, truck, and most of the other equipment they were using together. After his partners left, Dave found himself alone in the forest, living in a tent, with very few resources to get by on.

Cline</b> is a former Fulbright scholar and Associate Professor of Classics and Anthropology and is Chair of the Department of Classical and Semitic Languages and Literatures at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He is the author of several books and numerous articles on the ancient world, including <i>The Battles of Armageddon</i> (University of Michigan Press, 2000).</p>Cline, an associate professor of ancient history and archeology at George Washington University, begins his history of Jerusalem with mythical, biblical and archeological clues to its past, and the Roman histories of Josephus. Cline's narrative thread is the battles over control of a dusty village that took on increasing emotional content as it became a contested religious site. Cline claims "assimilation, annihilation and acculturation" through 10 empires and occupancies have left no one in the area today with "a legitimate pedigree definitively extending back to any of the original inhabitants." Of the alleged 118 conflicts over Jerusalem, few lacked a religious basis. Until 1917, Cline shows, Westerners controlled Jerusalem for less than a century. Beyond the Solomonic years, Jews have controlled the old city only since 1967. Perhaps no fragment of global real estate has been so volatile over so long a history. Despite sanguinary, even horrific detail from past memoirs and narratives, Cline's retelling is flat and repetitious, and the numerous references to Saddam Hussein, physically absent from this history, overreach in attempting immediate relevance. While a useful, well-annotated, textbookish guide to Jerusalem's violent past and present, it will not replace Karen Armstrong's stylish<i> Jerusalem.

Through analysis of folklore sources, a comprehensive picture of the banshee emerges, and the functions of the belief in this remarkable creature of the folk imagination are examined. Many issues associated with attitudes toward life and death are expressed through the banshee tradition, and changes in such attitudes down through the ages are also revealed in changing beliefs about the banshee&#39;s presence and activity. This book unravels that network of beliefs, drawing on a large body of oral and written sources, including literary accounts from the Old Irish period to the present, as well as folklore accounts collected over the past sixty years. Recent fieldwork brings the study up-to-date, showing that in many instances belief in the banshee is alive today.</p><p></p><h2>Tramp Royale</h2><p>The four-time Hugo Award-winning author recounts his travels around the world, detailing, in a never-before-published account, his experiences in places ranging from New Orleans to the Panama Canal to the African veldt.</p><p>Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p>This potboiler travelogue is the record of a 1953 jaunt around the world by the prolific SF writer ( Stranger in a Strange Land ) and his wife. Unpublished until now, the book tells of bargains that no longer exist, landmarks that have disappeared, and standard tourist experiences with natives, customs officers, tipping, hotels and transportation. The late Heinlein's (1907-1988) comments on the countries he visited are dated, facile and sometimes embarrassing, as when he approves of the Buenos Aires slums for their cleanliness, or praises Peron for his love of children, or criticizes foreigners for their failure to appreciate Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The work has little by way of style or insight to warrant its resurrection, but as his widow explains in her diffident introduction, she unearthed it when Heinlein's editor requested his unpublished manuscripts. Alas, his fans may be hard put to know what to do with it. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>INFINITY WATCH VOL. 1</h2><p>Run the Gauntlet from War to Crusade in this essential companion to Jim Starlin's Infinity Trilogy!

For the last several years, a team of four linguists, two from the United States and two from Israel, has been working in the village, documenting this extraordinary language and, little by little, deciphering it. In the summer of 2003, I was granted the immense privilege of accompanying the team on a three-day research trip to the village. To my knowledge, I am the only journalist from outside the region who has ever been there. </p><p> From the time the linguists first set foot in the village, they have striven ferociously to protect the privacy of the people they are studying. That is their job. Before they could even begin their fieldwork, the team spent many painstaking months earning the trust of the villagers. When I first learned of the project, and broached the idea of this book, the linguists felt, with ample justification, that the presence of any newcomer, much less a journalist, had the potential to capsize their entire endeavor. Because of this, I acceded to more constraints on my reporting than I normally would. These were arrived at in the course of nearly a year of transatlantic negotiations with the team's leader, Dr. Wendy Sandler of the University of Haifa, as I sought permission to make the trip. </p><p> During my time in the village I was, by prearrangement, a mostly silent observer of the linguists as they went about their work; at no time was I allowed to interview the villagers independently. (Given the breathtaking gulf between their native language and mine, this would have been no small trick anyhow.) Although the linguists continue to make regular research trips to the village, I was permitted to go along only this once. All of the scenes described in the narrative, and all of the dialogue, I saw and heard firsthand during the course of this visit. The only exception is the tale of the larcenous mice, which I have reconstructed based on an interview with the victim. My descriptions of the history and daily life of Al-Sayyid are based on my own observations, and on interviews with members of the research team. </p><p> There were other conditions. In exchange for permission to accompany the team, I agreed to show Dr. Sandler all portions of my manuscript pertaining to Al-Sayyid. Because of the exquisite cross-cultural sensitivity their work demands, the linguists are ethically obliged -- and, by extension, so am I -- not to disclose certain personal details about the life and inhabitants of Al-Sayyid that they have learned in the course of their visits. In the end, I chose to show the entire manuscript to Dr. Sandler as well as to the three other linguists on her team, Drs. Irit Meir, Carol Padden and Mark Aronoff. I have welcomed their corrections on matters of fact, their clarifications of technical material, and their suggestions for avenues of further inquiry. Matters of interpretation and emphasis, however, remain mine alone, as do any residual errors. </p><p> Dr. Sandler also expressed deep concern that with the publication of my book, this insular, traditional community might be overrun with curiosity-seekers and members of the news media. In keeping with the linguists' own practice, standard for this type of anthropological research, I have changed the name of every villager mentioned in the narrative. I have also disguised the precise location of the village, along with certain other identifying details. Consider Al-Sayyid a kind of signing Brigadoon (although it is very real, and I have seen it), a place utterly impossible for any outsider to find. I trust strongly that none will try. </p><p> In one other instance in the narrative, the brief account in Chapter 7 of a scholar who is said to make scientific generalizations about a language that "only he speaks," certain identifying details have been changed to protect the individual's privacy. </p><p> In recent decades, the field of sign-language linguistics has established itself as one of the most yeasty, contentious and promising branches of cognitive science. As such, it is awash in competing scholarly opinions. In a book written for a general readership, it is impossible to give an exhaustive account of either the historical development of the discipline or its present state of affairs. What this book offers is an introduction to the linguistic study of sign language in the form of a representative cross section of the field and its preoccupations from its beginnings in the 1960s to the present day. It is a slice -- one of many possible slices -- of sign-language linguistics at the start of the twenty-first century, and is by no means intended to represent the field in toto. A bibliographic essay at the end of the book offers suggestions for further reading. </p><p> Some notes on usage: Anyone who writes about deafness quickly discovers that worlds of meaning, politics and identity hang on the capitalization of a single letter: the initial "d" of the word "deaf." In the United States, it is often customary to capitalize "Deaf" when referring to any self-identified member of the large cultural minority, united by common language and traditions, of people who cannot hear. (The word is lowercased when it refers strictly to the audiological condition.) After much deliberation, I have chosen to keep the word "deaf" lowercased throughout the pages of this book. My only motivation is typographic consistency, in particular as it applies to the discussions of Al-Sayyid, where capital-D concepts like "Deaf culture" and "Deaf power" are unknown by virtue of the fact that it is so utterly ordinary to be deaf there. I have, however, retained the original capitalization of the word in all quoted matter. </p><p> When one is writing about sign language, verbs of attribution also grow thorny. On a physiological level, no one "speaks" sign language, or ever "says" anything in sign. Sign languages have users. They have signers. But, technically, don't have speakers. A work of this length, however, begs for stylistic variety, and as a result, I sometimes use verbs of speech -- "speak," "say," "talk" -- along with their derivatives, to refer to the act of signed communication, as in the title of the book itself. These words are meant purely as loose, colloquial metaphors, to be understood much as "spoke" is in the title of the anthropologist Nora Groce's lovely book, <i>Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language.</i> </p><p> In a book about cognitive science, the terms "mind" and "brain" also pose a challenge to smooth usage. I have in general adopted the familiar "hardware-versus-software" analogy, using "brain" to refer to the physical structure within the cranial cavity and "mind" to denote the range of operations this physical structure can perform. </p><p> <i>Talking Hands</i> is organized into seventeen chapters. The odd-numbered chapters form the narrative of the linguists' visit to Al-Sayyid and their subsequent work deciphering its language. The even-numbered chapters chart the course of sign-language linguistics: Chapters 2 and 4 offer an introduction to the signed languages of the world, and to the aims of modern linguistics. Chapters 6 and 8 chronicle the birth of the scientific study of sign language, and examine the very special conditions that give rise to "signing villages" like Al-Sayyid. Chapters 10 and 12 describe the grammar of signed languages, focusing on the unusual means by which they build words and sentences. Chapters 14 and 16 explore the psychology of sign language -- memory for signs, "slips of the hand," and so on -- and what sign language has to tell us about the neurological workings of human language in the brain. </p><p> Finally, a note on sign-language transcription. Following the convention of sign-language linguistics, the English glosses for signs are printed in small capital letters: FATHER, ROOSTER, THINK. Where a single sign is glossed using two or more English words, they are linked with hyphens: YOUNGER-BROTHER, TAKE-CARE-OF, LEFT-SIDE. Compound signs are glossed with a ligature mark: THRILL^INFORM. Words spelled out by means of the manual alphabet are capitalized and hyphenated: W-A-T-E-R. </p><p> </p><p> Text copyright � 2007 by Margalit Fox </p><p> The house is a lighted island in a sea of gathering dark. The sun has just gone down, and the desert breeze blowing in through the large open windows is cooler now. Outside, just beyond the house, fields of yellow stubble give way to a flat expanse of sand and scrub that stretches toward the distant hills ringing the horizon. A band of vermilion hangs above the hills, and above that, the sky is an inverted bowl of deep turquoise. Across the sand, a line of shadowy forms can be seen picking its way slowly toward the house: the village camels, home for the night. </p><p> From a nearby mosque, the muezzin's call to prayer floats through the open windows. The windows have deep marble sills but no glass, for the house is barely half-finished. Right now it is little more than walls, sheer slabs of whitewashed concrete that seem to rise organically from the surface of the desert. There is no front door yet, and no front steps: you enter, perilously, by clawing your way up a steep concrete ramp coated with blown sand. Inside, the house is hollow. Its half-dozen rooms have neither doors nor windows, and underfoot, where the floor will be, is only hard-packed dirt. Garlands of electrical wires sprout from the bare white walls; a black rubber hose of indeterminate purpose snakes across the ground from room to room. That is all there is to the house so far, but its raw state suits the desert. </p><p> On this summer evening, the half-built house is alive with people.

This irresistible graphic novel by longtime <i>Guardian</i> cartoonist Simmonds is roughly based on Hardy's <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> and uses it to depict the English upper-middle class having tawdry midlife crises. Beth, the wife of renowned author Nicholas Hardiman, runs an idyllic writer's retreat where she's parlayed her skill at caring for her husband into caring for other writers. She and her literary charges barely notice the locals who, jammed on council estates, look on with envy. Enter young Tamara Drewe, a newspaper columnist famed for her post&#x2013;plastic surgery beauty. With Ben, her rock-star boyfriend, and her citified ways, she knocks Beth's little group on its head and gets stalked by two local girls. After Ben leaves Tamara, she decides the already adulterous Nicholas would be a nice lay on the rebound, only he falls in love with her. The art captures British frumpiness so well it's scary; middle-age spread hulks through this book like sad weight, but it's less skilled with beauty; Tamara's looks don't sway the reader the way they sway the characters in the book. But the view on how feminism has failed in moneyed Britain is priceless. A wonderful and slightly evil book. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>Gossipy, lascivious, irreverent and wild -- just like Doris Duke, the woman who inspired this romp of a biography. Born the richest child in America, Duke broke free from the restraints of her privileged upbringing into a life of scandal, sexual conquest, inheritance and headlines, ending with her mysterious murder at the age of 80. A no-holds-barred look into the lives of the rich and famous."Really great sex" is what the very rich and the very poor can share, according to the late Doris Duke, because both have the time and the freedom to focus on it. The middle class is too busy with jobs and mortgages and college tuitions. Duke, the tobacco heiress who during her lifetime (1912-1993) was thought to be the world's richest woman, spent most of that life in search of the largest and most potent male organ, the winner being that of playboy Profirio Rubirosa, with Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku's the runner-up, although General Patton's won kudos too. The authors speculate on whether Duke deliberately killed one of her lovers, and they relate how, late in life, she learned to distinguish between sex and love and found the latter with author Louis Bromfield. The suspicious circumstances of her death are retold with renewed questions about her doctors' behavior and the last-minute codicil to her will, which left the major portion of her estate to her butler, "the Rasputin of the court of Doris Duke." Pony Duke (Doris's godchild), writing here with former nationally syndicated columnist Thomas, "really liked" her, but his portrait, drawn from his own and family members' recollections as well as public information, is not one of an easily likable woman.

He is a graduate of Columbia University and Yale Medical School, and is the former Chairman of Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, Florida.<b>Chapter 1</b><p><b><i>The Beginning</i></b></p><p>For those of you who have not read my book, <i>Many Lives, Many Masters,</i> a few words of introduction are necessary. You need to know something about me before we begin the work of healing.</p><p>Until my incredible experiences with Catherine, the patient whose therapy is described in the book, my professional life had been unidirectional and highly academic. I was graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, from Columbia University and received my medical degree from the Yale University School of Medicine, where I was also chief resident in psychiatry. I have been a professor at several prestigious university medical schools, and I have published over forty scientific papers in the fields of psychopharmacology, brain chemistry, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety states, substance abuse disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. My only previous contribution to book publishing had been <i>The Biology of Cholinergic Function,</i> which was hardly a bestseller, although reading it did help some of my insomniac patients fall asleep. I was left-brained, obsessive-compulsive, and completely skeptical of "unscientific" fields such as parapsychology. I knew nothing about the concept of past lives or reincarnation, nor did I want to.</p><p>Catherine was a patient who was referred to me about a year after I had become Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida. In her late twenties, a Catholic woman from New England, Catherine was quite comfortable with her religion, not questioning this part of her life. She was suffering from fears, phobias, paralyzing panic attacks, depression, and recurrent nightmares. Her symptoms had been lifelong and were now worsening.</p><p>After more than a year of conventional psychotherapy, she remained severely impaired. I felt she should have been more improved at the end of that time span. A hospital laboratory technician, she had the intelligence and insight to benefit from therapy. There was nothing in her basic makeup to suggest that her case would be a difficult one. Indeed, her background suggested a good prognosis. Since Catherine had a chronic fear of gagging and choking, she refused all medications, so I could not use antidepressants or tranquilizers, drugs I was trained to use to treat symptoms like hers. Her refusal mined out to be a blessing in disguise, although I did not realize it at that time.</p><p>Finally, Catherine consented to try hypnosis, a form of focused concentration, to remember back to her childhood and attempt to find the repressed or forgotten traumas that I felt must be causing her current symptoms.</p><p>Catherine was able to enter a deep hypnotic trance state, and she began to remember events that she consciously had been unable to recall. She remembered being pushed from a diving board and choking while in the water. She also recalled being frightened by the gas mask placed on her face in a dentist's office, and, worst of all, she remembered being fondled by her alcoholic father when she was three years old, his huge hand held over her mouth to keep her quiet. I was certain that now we had the answers. I was equally certain that now she would get better.</p><p>But her symptoms remained severe. I was very surprised. I had expected more of a response. As I pondered this stalemate, I concluded that there must be more traumas still buried in her subconscious. If her father had fondled her when she was three, perhaps he had done this at an even earlier age. We would try again.</p><p>The next week I once again hypnotized Catherine to a deep level. But this time, I inadvertently gave her an open-ended, nondirective instruction.</p><p>"Go back to the time from which your symptoms arise," I suggested.</p><p>I had expected Catherine to return once again to her early childhood.</p><p>Instead, she flipped back about four thousand years into an ancient near-Eastern lifetime, one in which she had a different face and body, different hair, a different name. She remembered details of topography, clothes, and everyday items from that time. She recalled events in that lifetime until ultimately she drowned in a flood or tidal wave, as her baby was torn from her arms by the force of the water. As Catherine died, she floated above her body, replicating the near death experience work of Dr. Elisabeth K�bler-Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Kenneth Ring, and others, work we will discuss in detail later in this book. Yet, she had never heard of these people or their work.</p><p>During this hypnosis session, Catherine remembered two other lifetimes. In one, she was a Spanish prostitute in the eighteenth century, and in another, a Greek woman who had lived a few hundred years after the near-Eastern lifetime.</p><p>I was shocked and skeptical. I had hypnotized hundreds of patients over the years, but this had never happened before. I had come to know Catherine well over the course of more than a year of intensive psychotherapy. I knew that she was not psychotic, did not hallucinate, did not have multiple personalities, was not particularly suggestible, and did not abuse drugs or alcohol. I concluded that her "memories" must have consisted of fantasy or dreamlike material.</p><p>But something very unusual happened. Catherine's symptoms began to improve dramatically, and I knew that fantasy or dreamlike material would not lead to such a fast and complete clinical cure. Week by week, this patient's formerly intractable symptoms disappeared as under hypnosis she remembered more past lives. Within a few months she was totally cured, without the use of any medicines.</p><p>My considerable skepticism was gradually eroding. During the fourth or fifth hypnosis session something even stranger transpired. After reliving a death in an ancient lifetime, Catherine floated above her body and was drawn to the familiar spiritual light she always encountered in the in-between-lifetimes state.</p><p>"They tell me there are many gods, for God is in each of us," she told me in a husky voice. And then she completely changed the rest of my life:</p><p>"Your father is here, and your son, who is a small child. Your father says you will know him because his name is Avrom, and your daughter is named after him. Also, his death was due to his heart. Your son's heart was also important, for it was backward, like a chicken's. He made a great sacrifice for you out of his love. His soul is very advanced...his death satisfied his parents' debts. Also he wanted to show you that medicine could only go so far, that its scope is very limited."</p><p>Catherine stopped speaking, and I sat in an awed silence as my numbed mind tried to sort things out. The room felt icy cold.</p><p>Catherine knew very little about my personal life. On my desk I had a baby picture of my daughter, grinning happily with her two bottom baby teeth in an otherwise empty mouth. My son's picture was next to it. Otherwise Catherine knew virtually nothing about my family or my personal history. I had been well schooled in traditional psychotherapeutic techniques. The therapist was supposed to be a tabula rasa, a blank tablet upon which the patient could project her own feelings, thoughts, and attitudes. These then could be analyzed by the therapist, enlarging the arena of the patient's mind. I had kept this therapeutic distance with Catherine. She knew me only as a psychiatrist, knew nothing of my past or of my private life. I had never even displayed my diplomas in the office.</p><p>The greatest tragedy in my life had been the unexpected death of our firstborn son, Adam, who was only twenty-three days old when he died early in 1971. About ten days after we had brought him home from the hospital, he had developed respiratory problems and projectile vomiting. The diagnosis was extremely difficult to make. "Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage with an atrial septal defect," we were told. "It occurs once in approximately every ten million births." The pulmonary veins, which were supposed to bring oxygenated blood back to the heart, were incorrectly routed, entering the heart on the wrong side. It was as if his heart were turned around, <i>backward.</i> Extremely, extremely rare.</p><p>Heroic open-heart surgery could not save Adam, who died several days later. We mourned for months, our hopes and dreams dashed. Our son, Jordan, was born a year later, a grateful balm for our wounds.</p><p>At the time of Adam's death, I had been wavering about my earlier choice of psychiatry as a career. I was enjoying my internship in internal medicine, and l had been offered a residency position in medicine. After Adam's death, I firmly decided that I would make psychiatry my profession. I was angry that modern medicine, with all of its advanced skills and technology, could not save my son, this simple, tiny baby.</p><p>My father had been in excellent health until he experienced a massive heart attack early in 1979, at the age of sixty-one. He survived the initial attack, but his heart wall had been irretrievably damaged, and he died three days later. This was about nine months before Catherine's first appointment.</p><p>My father had been a religious man, more ritualistic than spiritual. His Hebrew name, Avrom, suited him better than the English, Alvin. Four months after his death, our daughter, Amy, was born, and she was named after him.</p><p>Here in 1982 in my quiet, darkened office, a deafening cascade of hidden, secret truths was pouring upon me. I was swimming in a spiritual sea, and I loved the water. My arms were gooseflesh. Catherine could not possibly know this information. There was no place even to look it up. My father's <i>Hebrew</i> name, that I had a son who died in infancy from a one-in-ten million heart defect, my brooding about medicine, my father's death, and my daughter's naming -- it was too much, too specific, too true. This unsophisticated laboratory technician was a conduit for transcendental knowledge. And if she could reveal these truths, what else was there? I needed to know more.</p><p>"Who," I sputtered, "who is there? Who tells you these things?"</p><p>"The Masters," she whispered, "the Master Spirits tell me. They tell me I have lived eighty-six time...</p></p><h2>Vampire Hunter D Volume 9: The Rose Princess</h2><p>In Sakuri, a young woman is about to be sacrificed to the vampiric Noblewoman who reigns over the village.

In the Tombs</i> <br>&#x201c;O Rania, I was better off dead,&#x201d; muttered Menelaus Montrose, in English, a language which, he reflected, was also long dead. &#x201c;Unearthed and outmaneuvered, how in pestilent perdition am I going to outsmart getting myself killed entirely? How am I ever going to see you again?&#x201d; <br>Above, the sky was gray with snow clouds, and leaden. A storm was gathering along the southern horizon, above the glaciers now shrouding the Blue Ridge Mountains, the source of some immense, unnatural disturbance. <br>Downhill, the pines and frozen rocks were bare of life. The prison tents were empty, the deadly wire was motionless, and the odd seashell-shaped buildings beyond the wire were silent. <br>Directly underfoot, down a dizzying drop of catwalks and scaffolds, lay the darkness of the archeological dig. No coffins moved or fired. They were deactivated, returned meekly to their recharging plugs, and were no longer attempting to defend their precious, slumbering contents. <br>Instead, wild packs of the dog thing soldiers were dancing, whooping, and barking with elation among the ruins, whirling swords and pikes, flourishing muskets, in the triangle of light that spilled from the broken doors across the silent firing range. Montrose saw none of the dwarfish little bald Blue Men in their jewel-adorned coats. <br>He wondered how many hours he had before the persons of ordinary intelligence figured out that Corporal Anubis, allegedly a Beta-rank Chimera of the Sixth Millennium A.D., was instead Menelaus Illation Montrose, experiment in intelligence augmentation gone awry, of the Third Millennium A.D., the so-called Judge of Ages and Guardian of the Cryonic Tombs of the Slumbering Dead&#x2014;or how many minutes before Del Azarchel figured it out. <br>(That man was surely still alive! Fate was not kind enough to have killed off mankind&#x2019;s other experiment in human intelligence augmentation, mechanical rather than biological, during the thousands of years while Montrose slept in suspended animation. The two of them were still in mid-duel, a deadly fight momentarily put on hold during the immensities of human evolutionary history.) <br>Maybe they would not find the coffeepot, or his notebooks, or his gun collection, or his clothing closet. Of course, there was still the giant Texas flag he had pinned up, or the portrait of Rania, or his collection of history books, Witch idols, magazines and old coins with his image on them&nbsp;&#x2026; sweet Jesus up a tree! There were a lot of clues lying around. <br>Montrose watched in helpless anger as Rada Lwa was taken from him. He had carried the unconscious albino Scholar over his shoulder from the torture cell of the Blue Men. Rada Lwa was placed by the dogs into a sling and lowered from platform to platform into the Tombs. <br>Back in A.D. 3090 (over seven thousand four hundred years ago by the calendar, but just shy eight years ago by his oft-interrupted inner biological clock) Rada Lwa had attempted to assassinate Montrose. It was unforgivable. And yet the man, by entering the Tombs of the Judge of Ages, was under Montrose&#x2019;s protection. He was a client. To have Blue Men excavate Rada Lwa, thaw him, torture him, in Montrose&#x2019;s book, merited execution. But not ten minutes ago, he had discovered to his shock that the Blue Men were Thaws as well; in theory, his clients also under his protection. He blamed himself for not seeing it earlier. In hindsight, it was obvious. <br>While the dog things were busy lowering Rada Lwa, Montrose spoke to them in Intertextual: <i>&#x201c;You know your masters ain&#x2019;t really and truly archeologists, don&#x2019;t you, you sons of bitches?&#x201d;</i> <br>The Blue Men, all but whoever was behind them, thought they were looking for the mythical founder of the Tomb system, the demigod called the Judge of Ages: so called because he condemned to death any age of history which dared forget the reason for the Tombs, the point of accumulating slumbering knights and scientists. <br>The mythical founder was no myth, but stood among their prisoners, unrecognized, helpless as a child, and angrier than hell. <br>Montrose was answered by snarls and a prod in his back with the muzzles of muskets. The captain of the dogs, a stately Great Dane of heroic build, pointed with his cutlass, motioning Montrose to descend. <br>Montrose, with a smirk and a shrug, politely raised his hands in surrender, and walked and climbed down the last length of scaffolding into the cleft. <br>He tried once again, this time only addressing the Great Dane by name: <i>&#x201c;Rirk Refka Kak-Et, you do know your masters are Thaws who just so happened to wake up earlier than their fellow clients, and looted our coffins and thawed us against our will?&#x201d;</i> <br>Looking down, he saw that the armor was gone, peeled away by some immense force, along with the bedrock and the first three levels of the Tomb. Avalanches and snowfall had toppled this first level onto the second, and the second had been cut or blasted open to reveal the third, leaving only a set of protruding decks to the east and west like bookshelves. <br>As he descended, he saw above a squad of dogs lowering an oversized coffin using a block and tackle. As it passed him, swaying in the wind, he was close enough to read its alert lights: The Giant inside was awake, only mildly sedated, fully thawed and healed. The coffin was being used as a claustrophobic prison, not a hibernation unit. <br>Creaking, the lines lowered the Giant&#x2019;s coffin faster than Montrose (with dogs above him and dogs below) could negotiate the rungs of the synthetic tubing which formed the ladder. Montrose ached with the desire to speak with the Giant. His brain, due to its size, could match the feats Montrose&#x2019;s, due to its composition, could perform. A short conversation with him, and the many mysteries plaguing Montrose might be answered. <br>The wind grew soft as the sky shrank to merely a narrow blue ribbon above, and the sunlight grew dim. It was cold between the narrow canyon walls of stone, and colder still between the metal walls of the Tomb. <br> <i>&#x201c;Your masters, they do not know any more than I do who or what&#x2014;if anything&#x2014;is alive out there in the snowy wilderness of the Ice Age. Some human civilization is still on the surface, perhaps extremely advanced, and they will surely notice this activity here.&#x201d;</i> <br>The armored floor here was all but gone, and at the lip of this huge hole, the scaffolding the dog things had erected led down to the third level. Roofless, the floorplan of the third level was exposed. <br>To one side, the southern half was a labyrinth of cells and corridors worm-ridden with smaller passages designed for coffins to slide easily through, where men must duck walk or crawl, and murder-holes and ambush vents led from the smaller passages to the maze of main corridors. The northern half of the floorplan was an empty space of metal like a firing range, overlooked by a massive door. This door was thirty feet tall, with gunblisters and energy emitters thick as grapes on a trellis on its massively armored doorposts and lintel. The beetling cliff above the door to the fourth level was intact, so that the door was like a metal plug at the back of a throat of stone. <br>And the door was open. Gold light poured up from shining stairs. <br> <i>&#x201c;You know that, right? You savvy? Thaws are clients of the ultra-long-term hibernation tombs&#x2014;sleep in the ground, under the armor, for centuries, millennia, waiting for the End of Days when the star monsters come from the Hyades.&#x201d;</i> <br>Montrose did not mention that he, personally, was waiting for an event predicted to happen long, long after that. Driving off the Hyades invasion was meant merely to preserve the Earth in her Earthly state until Princess Rania returned. <br>He looked down at a noise. He saw Oenoe, garbed in her green mantilla, walking serenely between two lines of cavorting and howling dog things. The strange angle of the light from the open door cast the shadows of the dog things like angular phantoms across the walls, whose jerking dance was a thing from boyhood nightmares. <br>With her was Soorm the Hormagaunt, unconscious, or dead, being hauled limply in the metal clamps of a lumbering automaton. Preceptor Naar, looking bored, rode atop the walking machine. <br> <i>&#x201c;Did your little Blue bosses warn you about the star monsters? They will be here in a century. A dark mass, equal to a small gas giant, has been approaching us from Oculus Borealis for the last eight millennia.&#x201d;</i> <br>Down the final ladder, there was steel floor underfoot. Menelaus and his dog escort stood in a narrow corridor which connected both halves of the level. The connecting corridor was supposed to be the most dangerous spot here. To the east were powerhouses and storage vats for the dangerous nanomaterial used in biosuspension, as well as the main and secondary refrigerant systems. To the west were staff living quarters and utility rooms and guard stations with periscopes leading to the surface. This corridor was open both to the massive guns of the door, and to the sniper fire from the secretive coffins. <br> <i>&#x201c;When the Hyades arrive, the Master of the World, a posthuman named Del Azarchel&#x2014;even you have heard of him, I see&#x2014;and the externalized Machine Intelligence of Del Azarchel, Exarchel, wise beyond all the genius of the Blue Men, will sell mankind into slavery, and the Blue Men will be to the Domination of the Hyades as dogs are to men&#x2014;no matter how smart, still just pets.&#x201d;</i> <br>The artificially anthropomogrified creature did not speak, but from the flex of its spine and the prick of its ears, Montrose saw that his words had struck home. Now the dog captain was listening carefully. <br> <i>&#x201c;Is that what you want for your masters? For Mentor Ull and Invigilator Illiance? Lives of servitude? Or worse?&#x201d;</i> <br>The dog thing said nothing, but looked at Montrose with eyes as hard as stones, ears laid flat against its skull. <br> <i>&#x201c;Do you know Ull and Illiance and all the Blues here are serving the Machine? Well? Did you know that?&#x201d;</i> <br>The Great Dane&#x2019;s answer was to cuff him backhand across the mouth. <br> <i>2. The Connecting Corridor</i> <br>By the time Montrose had reached the level in the gloomy corridor where the other prisoners were being kept, the Giant&#x2019;s coffin was out of sight. There was a splash of light on the wall opposite, a reflection of the golden light pouring out from the opened door, which was blurred and darkened for a moment with shadows as the bulky coffin of the Giant was maneuvered into the stairwell. A moment later the shadows passed, and the reflections gleamed again undisturbed. <br>At the northern mouth of the connecting corridor, the Blue Men had piled their sandbags, raised square shields of refractory reflex metal, pulled up floor plates, and dug in their gunnery nests. A second line of defense had been erected at the other end of the long corridor, to fend off still-active coffins that attempted from time to time to sally and dislodge them. Beyond this line of sandbags, the wreckage of such sallies clogged the labyrinth of corridors to the south. <br>Menelaus, his robes of metallic tent material clashing as he stepped, walked down the connecting corridor. <br>Larz the Fixer, one of the prisoners, relaxed, chuckling to himself. Larz was lying on his back atop an impromptu cot of toppled sandbags with an enormously smug look on his face and his hands tucked behind his head. Next to him was a bowl and several small bottles of rice wine, some empty and some not. <br>This was the man, this worthless little man, a low-caste Kine from the time of the Chimerae, who had boasted to the Blue Men that he could force open the Tomb door. <br>Larz was not dressed in his prison overalls, but was in an extravagant civilian costume from the late 5900s: The half cloak of the overalls of the Kine, instead of bearing his name and assignment, was covered with gauds and bezants, with coils of braid at the shoulders and colored scarves hanging from the armpits. He wore the bright pink boots of a professional kick-fighter. The switchblades in the boot toes clicked open and shut like little blunt-nosed creatures flicking out their tongues as Larz idly drummed his heels against the deck. <br>The serpentine stolen from Yuen the Alpha Chimera was lying near his hand, and it was extended to its full length: it lay like a thread of silver water across the empty expanse of steel floor, winding here and there to avoid buried mines and pressure plates, reaching from the sandbags to the door controls, where it had found a compatible plug. <br>&#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; Montrose muttered in English, his eyes narrowed. Larz could not have hacked his locks and wards. Either Soorm had opened the Tomb doors from the inside, or something equally unlikely. Could Larz be a Hospitalier in disguise? <br>He tried to stop and speak to Larz, but Larz, thinking him a Beta Chimera from his era, cowered back, whimpering and calling on the dogs to protect him, and the dogs in turn hustled Menelaus down the corridor past Larz. <br>Midway between the northern and southern defensive positions were bales of ammo and other supplies, as well as angry digging automata in need of minor repair. <br>Nearly a score of figures could be seen there, separated by armed automata and watched by their assigned guard dogs, who were looking with envy at their dancing brothers not far away, yapping and yammering, tails wagging. <br>The prisoners were all dressed in their period costumes. Menelaus wondered why the prisoners, now, had their garments returned to them. The Blue Men were very na�ve and stupid in some ways, but sharply intelligent in others, close enough to posthuman in their thinking patterns that they could control lateral thought-techniques to see gestalt patterns in events. A man with his clothing and possessions on him altered his &#x201c;tells,&#x201d; his body language and subconscious reactions. All the Blues need do, if they were as smart as Menelaus thought they were, was observe the prisoner&#x2019;s behavior in the Tombs, and compare this to the reactions of any undamaged information systems in the Tombs to the prisoners. Any wrong reactions would pinpoint the imposter. Had Montrose been visible to the Tomb systems, this tactic would have no doubt already revealed him. <br>Coming down the corridor, passing within perhaps three feet of Menelaus, was Invigilator Illiance in his jeweled coat. He gave Menelaus a polite nod, but did not pause to exchange any words. <br>In his hands was the coffeepot from Menelaus&#x2019; workroom. <br>Illiance glided down the corridor toward the silent firing range chamber. He was too small to block the light from the door when he went downstairs, or at least, not enough to alter the reflection of the light bouncing from a distant floor to the nearby wall, but Menelaus could hear the soft, light footsteps passing without hurry down and down. <br>Menelaus observed his fellow prisoners. <br>There were seventeen Thaws here: First was the waif perhaps named Alalloel from the Eleventh Millennium. Only four hundred years displaced from her native time. He attempted to contact her with his implants, but the signal did not generate any return. Perhaps she was ignoring him, or perhaps the Blue Men were wise enough to dampen her instruments. <br>Second and third were the two gray twins, a male and a female, from the Ninth Millennium. They were very similar to the Blue Men, but seemed to be a later development from them. <br>Next were two Hormagaunts, two Clade-dwellers, and three Donors from the Iatrocracy period in the Eighth Millennium. <br>After that were four Chimerae and three Kine from the Sixth Millennium. <br>The Thaws were not st...</p><h2>Taming the Kundalini</h2><p>Tamng the kundalini is a collection of letters written by Swami Satyananda Saraswati to a close disciple,during the period 1959-62.Through this detailed and intimate account of yogic and spiritual training,the reader is given a rare glimpse into the unfoldment of the guru-disciple relationship and the implementation of progressive sadhana as a powerful tool to awaken consciousness, In this book Swamiji offers to all,his spiritual advice and encouragemnt and leads the reader into a deeper understanding of the human place within the universe.</p><p>Swami Satyananda Saraswati hardly needs any introduction to Amazon visitors.Many of his books carry five star ratings and the best of the best sellers being Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha. <p>Born in 1923.

ISBN: 0810932024</p><p>Jean Dunand, one of the foremost exponents of the French Art Deco stye, was known chiefly for his work in lacquered wood and metal. His prodigious output of furniture, screens, and decorative metal vessels culminated in a large commission for the decorative wall panels in the luxury liner Normandie in the 1930s. Marcilhac has produced an exhaustive biography and catalog of the accomplishments of Dunand and his sons, who worked with him until his death in 1942. The book is lavishly illustrated with large, spectacular color photographs and smaller, rather murky black-and-white photographs of the artist and his works. The text is mainly a chronological narrative of Dunand's professional life and is somewhat lacking in human interest.

It tell us, for example, what the sixties were truly all about, not by reporting on the psychedelic decade but by recreating it, from the inside out. In the process, this stunningly original seriocomic thriller is fully capable of simultaneously eating a literary hot dog and eroding the borders of the mind.</p><p>It's clear that when Robbins sits down to write, he has one thing on his mind: having himself some fun. I read <b>Another Roadside Attraction,</b> years ago, then immediately went back to the beginning of the book and read it again. Robbins holds nothing back in this, his first novel.

Shortly before she died, she left a legacy with this beautiful book of 200 meat-free recipes from all over the world. <i>Linda McCartney on Tour</i> is illustrated with stunning photographs guaranteed to start you salivating--the tastes, colors, and textures leap off the page. You can almost taste the Crispy Vegetable Wontons (China), Asparagus Crepes (France), Minted Pea and Spinach Soup (U.K.), Vegetable Kichdi (India), Warm Chocolate Souffle with Bittersweet Sauce (France), and Fragrant Coconut Rice (Thailand). If you like pizza, choose from recipes of the U.K., U.S., Thailand, or Greece, or invent your own pizza with a page of creative topping selections. Although many of the dishes sound esoteric, the ingredients won't send you searching in ethnic stores--you can find most in your supermarket, though you will need to frequent a natural-foods market for a few, such as organic eggs and vegetarian sausages. The recipes have no nutritional information, unfortunately--you know you're getting plenty of vitamins and fiber, but you don't know fat content. Whether you're a confirmed vegetarian looking for new recipes or you just want to improve your health by eating meat-free a few times a week, this book will entice you. <i>--Joan Price</i>The late Linda McCartney was a passionate vegetarian campaigner whose desire to see a non-meat eating world led her to write her own successful cookbooks.

It was the only I.O.U. I received and I shall treasure it always.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, I haven&#x2019;t decided what I want to do yet. There isn&#x2019;t much you can do with a liberal arts major these days. Mother&#x2019;s bridge club keeps asking me when I&#x2019;m going to get married, so they have a pretty firm grasp of the situation at least. It seems careless of me to have broken up with Austin in my senior year. Now I have to think up something to do! I have given myself until the end of the summer to decide.<br> &nbsp;<br> How are things with you? Is Tax Law 307 still putting you to sleep? Your new roommate Milo sounds interesting. Do archeologists make much money? What does he look like?<br> &nbsp;<br> You may have noticed the enclosed invitation to Cousin Eileen&#x2019;s wedding. I enclosed it partly at Mother&#x2019;s insistence and partly as proof of martyrdom.<br> &nbsp;<br> They want me to be a bridesmaid. Well, I don&#x2019;t suppose &#x201c;want&#x201d; is exactly the right way to put it. I expect I&#x2019;m a necessary evil: the poor cousin drafted in lieu of friends, because of course Eileen hasn&#x2019;t got friends&#x2014;unless she made some at Cherry Hill; and Aunt Amanda would never let this affair degenerate into a reunion of mental patients. Though of course it will be anyway, with all those Chandlers present. I myself will probably have to be taken away after a week of their collective presence. I never saw why they had to send her away, did you? All Chandlers considered, they could have just cordoned off the place and sent in ten nurses. Did you know that Aunt Amanda still refers to Cherry Hill as a &#x201c;finishing school&#x201d;?<br> &nbsp;<br> The real purpose of this letter is to appeal to your better nature (assuming you have one) to persuade you to accompany me to this blessed event. I do not want to suffer alone. In fact, I feel that since you are older than I, you should be the one sacrificed (firstborn son, and all that), but then I can see that you&#x2019;d make a terrible bridesmaid.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know already that you are either going to ignore this letter or write back some tripe about your law courses keeping you too busy to go. Well, I will give you forty-eight hours to answer, and then I&#x2019;m writing Aunt Amanda that we will be delighted to come to dear Eileen&#x2019;s wedding.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your atavistic sister,<br> &nbsp;<br> Elizabeth<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> June 2<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear Bill,<br> &nbsp;<br> I was kidding about the forty-eight hours. You did not have to send a Mailgram. Anyway, since I am your sister, I am not likely to believe that you have to go to your grandmother&#x2019;s funeral.<br> &nbsp;<br> Please thank Milo for the description of himself, but tell him I didn&#x2019;t find it very enlightening. I am not thrilled by the fact that he has a &#x201c;cranial capacity of 1,350 cc, a foramen magnum facing directly down, and a pyramidal-shaped mastoid process.&#x201d; Does he still leave bones scattered on the kitchen table? You two deserve each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother is worried about your dietary habits. She wanted me to ask if you are eating anything green and leafy. (Dad looked up from the newspaper and said: &#x201c;Money.&#x201d;)<br> &nbsp;<br> By the way, I most certainly will not give your message to Eileen. I looked up Hamlet, Act III&#x2014;Scene I, lines 63-64: &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2019;Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.&#x201d; Most unfunny. Aunt Amanda still hasn&#x2019;t forgiven you for referring to Eileen&#x2019;s release from Cherry Hill as her &#x201c;coming-out party.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I am going alone to the wedding&#x2014;hereafter to be referred to as The Ordeal. Mother was willing to go, but Dad said he&#x2019;d rather be staked out on an anthill. So I&#x2019;m going by bus. If you had gone, we could have driven down.<br> &nbsp;<br> I hope your law books fall on you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Elizabeth<br> &nbsp;<br> June 2<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear Aunt Amanda,<br> &nbsp;<br> We are delighted to hear about Eileen&#x2019;s wedding. Thank you for inviting me to be a bridesmaid. I&#x2019;ll be happy to accept, but I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m the only MacPherson who can come.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad and Mother had already arranged to go to a sales convention in Columbia, and Bill is simply prostrate with grief that he can&#x2019;t make it, but he has tests that week in law school.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ll be arriving on Wednesday afternoon about two-thirty at the bus station in Chandler Grove.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking forward to seeing you all again,<br> &nbsp;<br> Elizabeth<br> &nbsp;<br> P.S. I think you will have to alter that bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress. I did not, as you predicted, grow up to be a size sixteen.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE CHANDLER GROVE bus station was a dingy yellow waiting room whose openings and closings were probably dictated by TV Guide. Flies hovered lazily about the torn screen door, some drifting over to the faded drink machine, whose dents testified to its dubious honesty. Near the counter was a rack of travel pamphlets that Elizabeth might well have to read if someone did not turn up soon to claim her. She picked up the least dusty brochure (Florida, of course) and sat down in the plastic chair to wait.<br> &nbsp;<br> She decided that she would be disappointed if the first circle of hell were not a bus station waiting room where you waited forever for people you didn&#x2019;t like who weren&#x2019;t going to come for you anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her blue suitcase rested within inches of her foot, in case the crazed felon Aunt Amanda always swore inhabited bus stations should dash through the room and snatch it on the run. If he did, she hoped the dress would fit him&#x2014;and if he would consent to take her place at The Ordeal, he was welcome to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced at the suitcase, imagining the permanent wrinkles it was grinding in the yellow bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress. Yellow. Aunt Amanda had either remembered or surmised that Elizabeth looked ghastly in yellow. No, more likely she hadn&#x2019;t given it a thought. The Chandlers would scarcely consider the country cousin in their choice of wedding colors for dear Eileen.<br> &nbsp;<br> So here I am, thought Elizabeth, the sacrificial lamb of the MacPherson Clan, shunted down to Chandler Grove and decked out in malarial yellow to see Eileen married off to What&#x2019;s-His-Name.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least it would be a distraction. Anything would be better than the postpartum depression of having received a degree in sociology and no job prospects. Her father wanted her to go to graduate school, but she couldn&#x2019;t face that decision just yet. It felt too much like postponing life. She stared at the rack of travel brochures&#x2014;there was always the Peace Corps. Reconciling with Austin out of sheer panic suddenly seemed dangerously easy.<br> &nbsp;<br> After all, Austin was well on his way to becoming an architect. He would soon be so well established that Elizabeth could postpone life-determining decisions indefinitely. Though, of course, marrying Austin would have been a life-determining decision. It would lock her forever into the world of tailgate picnics and country club dances. &#x201c;You just know there&#x2019;s always an alligator somewhere on his person,&#x201d; Bill had said. But she had been able to overlook his conventionality; much is forgiven of tanned, wiry blonds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her disenchantment had been gradual. She began to see the birthday and Christmas gifts of Bermuda bags and add-a-beads as a tacit reproach of her own taste. The feeling culminated on a golden April afternoon as they strolled along the path by the campus duck pond. Austin had gazed tenderly into her eyes and said: &#x201c;If you lose ten pounds, I&#x2019;ll marry you.&#x201d; Elizabeth pushed him into the pond and walked off without a backward glance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I come from haunts of coot and hern,&#x201d; said a solemn voice behind her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Elizabeth turned around to see what was obviously a Chandler. He was in his early twenties, and he had the look of a faun in country tweeds.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must be Geoffrey,&#x201d; she said, after a moment&#x2019;s study.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know. I must. I once thought of being Caligula, but when Alban came back from Europe as Ludwig of Bavaria I gave it up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Alban? Aunt Louisa&#x2019;s son? I haven&#x2019;t heard of him since she sent him off to William and Mary to become a &#x2018;suthen&#x2019; gentleman.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My dear, you are quite out of it,&#x201d; Geoffrey assured her. &#x201c;After he graduated&#x2014;KA with a B.A.&#x2014;Aunt Louisa took him on the grand tour. The castles and churches of Ye Olde Worlde. Unfortunately, they visited Bavaria, and Alban became smitten with that fairy-tale thing that looks like the Disneyland castle. Built by King Ludwig, who was crazy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know soon.&#x201d; He sighed theatrically. &#x201c;Far too soon. Is this blue suitcase yours? Shall I carry it for you and further impress you with my good breeding?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elizabeth stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad to be rescued, I don&#x2019;t care who carries it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Geoffrey raised one expressive eyebrow. &#x201c;The prospect of going to Long Meadow strikes you as a rescue?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There didn&#x2019;t seem to be an answer to this one.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Written on the Body</h2><p>Written on the Body [paperback] WINTERSON, Jeanette [Jan 01, 1993]</p><p>The most beguilingly seductive novel to date from the author of The Passion and Sexing the Cherry.

Faron's writing advice focuses on identifying the basic traits of perps and pigeons (60 percent of pigeons are seniors, but we're all susceptible), defining the lingo (drag broad, shaky mom, mish roll, etc.), and counseling writers to "tell the story from the point of view of the victim." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p><h2>The One Gift</h2><p>Enjoy this new novel about the journey of the frankincense trail in ancient times.

The ragged crimson petals of "Fringed Carnival" resemble a masquerader's feather headpiece. Feinstein allows the flowers to speak for themselves, limiting his text to each variety's name and a brief introduction, in which he explains his inspiration for the title: "with my mouth dropping open almost continuously" while photographing the flowers, the words "the infinite tulip" burst forth.

After learning that one of his great aunt&#x2019;s beloved and rare white bulldogs has been poisoned, the Orthodox bishop knows there is only one detective clever enough to investigate the murder: Sister Pelagia.<br><br>The bespectacled, freckled Pelagia is lively, curious, extraordinarily clumsy, and persistent. At the estate in question, she finds a whole host of suspects, any one of whom might have benefited if the old lady (who changes her will at whim) had expired of grief at the pooch&#x2019;s demise. There&#x2019;s Pyotr, the matron&#x2019;s grandson, a nihilist with a grudge who has fallen for the maid; Stepan, the penniless caretaker, who has sacrificed his youth to the care of the estate; Miss Wrigley, a mysterious Englishwoman who has recently been named sole heiress to the fortune; Poggio, an opportunistic and freeloading &#x201c;artistic&#x201d; photographer; and, most intriguingly, Naina, the old lady&#x2019;s granddaughter, a girl so beautiful she could drive any man to do almost anything.<br><br>As Pelagia bumbles and intuits her way to the heart of a mystery among people with faith only in greed and desire, she must bear in mind the words of Saint Paul: &#x201c;Beware of dogs&#x2013;and beware of evil-doers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have praised [Akunin&#x2019;s] clever plots, vivid characters and wit.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Baltimore Sun<br></i><br>&#x201c;Akunin&#x2019;s wonderful novels are always intricately webbed and plotted.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Providence Journal</i></p><p><b>Boris Akunin </b>is the pen name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, who was born in the republic of Georgia in 1956.

If someone should ever happen to glance down at Zavolzhsk from those heavenly spheres out of which the lamps of the night pour forth their bright rays, then the picture presented to that fortunate person&#x2019;s eyes would surely be one of some enchanted kingdom: the River sparkling lazily, the roofs glittering, the gas lamps flickering in the streets, and, hovering over all the shimmer and glimmer of this multifarious radiance, the tremulous silvery chiming of the cicada choir.<br><br>But let us return to the reverend Mitrofanii. Our passing reference to nature was made purely and simply to explain why on such a night even the most ordinary of men, far less burdened with cares than the bishop of the province, would find sleep hard to come by. It is hardly surprising that ill-wishers, of whom every man has some, even this worthy pastor being no exception, should claim that it is not our governor, Anton Antonovich von Haggenau, but His Grace who is the true ruler of this extensive region.<br><br>Extensive indeed the region may be, but densely populated it is not. The only genuine town it can really be said to possess is Zavolzhsk, and the others, including the district centers, are more like overgrown villages with a few stone administrative buildings clustered around a single square, a small cathedral, and a hundred or two little log houses with tin roofs of the kind that since time immemorial have for some reason always been painted green in these parts.<br><br>And, God knows, even the provincial capital is no Babylon&#x2014;at the time we are describing, its entire population amounted to twenty-three thousand five hundred eleven individuals of both sexes. Although, of course, during the week following Transfiguration, if no one was to die, the number of inhabitants was expected to increase by two souls, because the wife of the manager of the provincial chancelry, Shtops, and the tradesman&#x2019;s wife, Safulina, were near their time, and the general opinion was that the latter was already overdue.<br><br>The custom of maintaining a strict accounting of the population had only been introduced recently, under the current administration, and then only in the towns. How many folk there may be making a living out in the forests and the swamps is something known only to God&#x2014;go try counting them! The dense, impenetrable thickets extend for hundred of miles from the River all the way to the Ural Mountains, with schismatic monastic communities and salt factories buried among them, and along the banks of the dark, deep rivers that, for the most part, have no names at all, dwells the Zyt tribe, a quiet and submissive people of Ugrian blood.<br><br>The only mention of the ancient life of our obscure province is contained in the Nizhny-Novgorod Miscellany, a chronicle from the fifteenth century. It speaks of a Novgorodian visitor by the name of Ropsha who was captured by &#x201c;the wild, bare-bellied pagans&#x201d; in the green forests and lost his head in a sacrifice to the stone idol Shishiga, and as the chronicler for some reason finds it necessary to explain, &#x201c;this Ropsha did perish and give up the ghost and was buried without a head.&#x201d;<br><br>But that was long ago, in the time of myth. Nowadays a splendid peace reigns supreme in these parts, with no brigandage on the roads, no killing, and even the wolves in the local forests are noticeably fatter and lazier than in other provinces, due to the abundance of wild- life here. God grant everyone a life as good as ours. And as for the murmurings of the bishop&#x2019;s detractors, we shall not undertake to discuss here who is the genuine ruler of the Zavolzhie region&#x2014;the reverend Mitrofanii, the governor Anton Antonovich, the governor&#x2019;s most learned advisers, or even, perhaps, the governor&#x2019;s wife, Ludmila Platonovna&#x2014;because it is not for us to judge such things. Let us merely say that His Grace has far more allies and admirers in Zavolzhie than enemies.<br><br>Recently, however, certain events had encouraged and emboldened the latter, thereby giving Mitrofanii particular reasons for his insomnia, in addition to those related to the frenzied trilling of the cicadas. This was the reason for the frown that pleated his high forehead into three folds and knitted his thick black brows together.<br><br>The Bishop of Zavolzhsk was fair of face, not merely good-looking but strikingly handsome, so that instead of being a pastor, he might easily have been some Old Russian prince or Byzantine archistrategus. His hair was long and gray, but his beard, also long and silky, was still half black as yet, and there was not so much as a single silver thread in his mustache. His glance was keen, but generally gentle and clear, which made it all the more frightening when it clouded over with anger and flashed with lightning. At such terrible moments the stern creases over his cheekbones were more pronounced, as was the aquiline curve of his large, noble nose. The reverend bishop&#x2019;s deep, resonant voice with its rumble of thunder was equally well suited for a cordial private conversation, an inspired sermon, or a civic speech on one of the occasions when he attended the Holy Synod.<br><br>In his young days, Mitrofanii had been an adherent of asceticism. He used to wear a cassock made of sackcloth, mortify the flesh by constant fasting, and even, so they say, wear chains of cast iron beneath his undershirt, but he had long since abandoned these austerities, having come to regard them as vain, immaterial, and even harmful to a genuine love of God. Having reached the age of maturity and attained wisdom, he became more considerate of his own flesh and that of others, and for his everyday vestments his preference lay in cassocks of fine cloth, blue or black. And on occasion, when the authority of his bishop&#x2019;s title required it, he would robe himself in a mantle of extremely precious purple velvet, order a team of six horses to be harnessed to the bishop&#x2019;s formal carriage, and insist that there must be two stately lay brothers with thick beards standing on the runningboards, wearing green cassocks trimmed with galloons that looked very much like livery.<br><br>Of course, there were those who surreptitiously reproached His Grace for his sybaritic habits and devotion to grand style, but even they did not condemn him too harshly, remaining mindful of the exalted origins that had accustomed Mitrofanii to luxury from his childhood, so that he did not regard it as being in any way important&#x2014;&#x201c;he did not deign to notice it,&#x201d; as his clerk, Father Serafim Userdov, put it.<br><br>His Grace the Bishop of Zavolzhsk was born into a family of courtly nobles and graduated from the Corps of Pages, from where he moved to the Horse Guards (that was back in the reign of Nikolai Pavlovich). He led the life usual for a young man of his circle, and if he was distinguished in any way from his peers, it was perhaps only by a tendency to philosophize, but then that is not such a very rare thing among educated and sensitive youths. In his regiment the &#x201c;philosopher&#x201d; was considered a good comrade and an excellent cavalryman, his superiors liked him and they promoted him, so that by the age of thirty he would certainly have risen to the rank of colonel had the Crimean campaign not intervened. God only knows what insights were revealed to the future Bishop of Zavolzhsk during his first taste of active combat, a cavalry skirmish near Balaclava, but after recovering from his saber wound, he had no wish to take a weapon into his hand ever again. He retired from the army, said his farewells to his family, and soon thereafter was serving his novitiate in one of the country&#x2019;s most isolated monasteries. Even now, however, especially when Mitrofanii conducted the service in the cathedral on the occasion of one of the twelve great feasts or took the chair at a meeting of the consistory, it was easy to imagine how he used to command his lancers in his booming voice: &#x201c;Squadron, sabers at the ready! At a trot, forward!&#x201d;<br><br>An extraordinary man will make his mark in any field of endeavor, and Mitrofanii did not languish in the obscurity of remote monastic life for long. Just as he had previously become the youngest squadron commander in the entire light cavalry, so now it fell to him to become the youngest Orthodox bishop. Initially appointed to be suffragan bishop here in Zavolzhsk, and then as the pastor of the province, he demonstrated so much wisdom and zeal that he was soon summoned to the capital to take up a high position in the church. There were many who predicted that in the none too distant future Mitrofanii would don the black veil of a metropolitan, but he astonished everyone by once again turning off the beaten track and requesting out of the blue to be allowed to return to us in the back of beyond, and, following long attempts to dissuade him, to the joy of us Zavolzhians he was released with a blessing, never again to abandon his modest see, so remote from the capital.<br><br>And what does it matter if it is remote? It is a well-known fact that the farther one travels from the capital, the nearer one approaches to God. And our exalted and far-seeing capital will reach out a thousand miles should such an idea ever come into its head.<br><br>It was indeed due to precisely such an idea that His Grace was not sleeping on this night, but attending drearily and without pleasure to the endless crescendos of the cicadas. The capital&#x2019;s idea possessed a face and a name, it was called Synodical Inspector Bubentsov, and as he pondered how to deal with this gentleman, the reverend bishop turned for the hundredth time from one side to the other on his soft duck-down mattress, groaning and sighing and occasionally gasping.<br><br>The bed in the bishop&#x2019;s bedchamber was special, an old four-poster from Empress Elizabeth&#x2019;s time, with a canopy representing a starry sky. During the period of Mitrofanii&#x2019;s aforementioned enthusiasm for asceticism, he slept quite contentedly on either straw or bare boards until he came to the conclusion that to mortify the flesh was pointless folly and that was not why the Lord had molded it in His own image and likeness, nor was it appropriate for the arch-pastor to make a show of himself to the clergy in his care, compelling them to adopt a self-tormenting severity for which some do not feel any spiritual inclination&#x2014;nor indeed are they obliged to do so according to the statute of the church. As he reached his years of maturity, His Grace inclined more and more to the opinion that genuine trials are sent down to us not in the realm of the physiological but in the realm of the spiritual, and the scourging of the body by no means always leads to the salvation of the soul. Therefore the bishop&#x2019;s chambers were furnished no worse than the governor&#x2019;s house, the board set in the refectory was incomparably superior, and the orchard of apple trees was the finest in all the town, with arbors, rotundas, and even a fountain. It was peaceful and shady there, inclining one to thought, and so let the detractors whisper among themselves&#x2014;one can never silence malicious gossip.<br><br>So the way to deal with this perfidious inspector Bubentsov is this, the reverend bishop concluded. The first thing is to write to Konstantin Petrovich in St. Petersburg about all the tricks that his trusted nuncio gets up to and the disaster that the church could suffer as a result of them. The chief procurator was a man of intelligence; it was possible that he might heed the warning. But action should not be limited to a letter; Mitrofanii must also summon the governor&#x2019;s wife, Ludmila Platonovna, for a talk, to shame her and stir her conscience. She was a good, honest woman. She must be brought to her senses.<br><br>And then everything would be put to rights. The matter could hardly be simpler.<br><br>But even now that his heart felt eased, sleep still would not come, and the problem did not lie in the round-faced moon, or even in the cicadas.<br><br>Knowing his own character as he did and being in the habit of analyzing the workings of its mechanism in detail, down to the last nut and bolt, Mitrofanii set about trying to identify the worm that was gnawing at him and preventing his reason from shrouding itself in the veil of sleep. What was the cause?<br><br>Could it possibly be his recent conversation with a giddy young novice from a noble family who had been denied permission to take the veil? The reverend bishop had not beaten about the bush; he had blurted out his opinion without equivocation: &#x201c;My daughter, what you need is not the Sweet Bridegroom of Heaven&#x2014;that is merely your delusion. What you need is a perfectly ordinary bridegroom, a state official or, even better, an officer. With a mustache.&#x201d; He ought not to have put it like that, of course. There had been hysterics, followed by a long, exhausting argument. But never mind that, it was unimportant. What else was there?<br><br>He had been obliged to take a disagreeable decision concerning the steward at the Monastery of the Epiphany. For riotous drunken behavior and the lecherous visiting of indecorous women, the offender had been condemned to dismissal from the cloister and returned to his original lay status. Now the scribbling would begin, with letters to His Grace himself and to the synod. But this too was an ordinary matter; the root cause of his alarm did not lie here.</p><h2>The Four Ingredient Cookbooks-Three Cookbooks in One!</h2><p>700 recipes, each uses only 4 ingredients.

After Sam passed away, Peggy married Nicholas Freydberg, also a publisher, environmentalist, sailor, and intellect. Peggy and Nick's love of Martha's Vineyard brought them there year round in 1969. There Peggy wrote several novels in a writing tent Nick set up for her on their lawn, including her memoir<i>Growing Up in Old Age</i>, which courageously confronted her fear of dying, asking the question, "Am I to spend the rest of my life in the fear of losing it?" &nbsp;While Peggy was writing her memoir tackling universal themes of aging, death, and fear, her beloved Nick passed away at 87. At 90 years old, Peggy was no longer able to write in long form and began writing the poems in this collection.

But when teenage Hideki accidentally acquires Chi, a sexy but exceedingly childlike persocom, his life gets complicated. Chi, who acquires knowledge and forms attachments quickly, soon falls for Hideki and does anything to make him happy-including dance at a burlesque club to earn him cash. Hideki doesn't know what to make of Chi's affections; furthermore, he's appalled by her behavior. Worse, he learns the teacher he adores has run away with his best friend, who leaves in Hideki's care another persocom who's quite shrill. As Hideki struggles through this chaos, Chi takes solace in a picture book apparently written just for persocoms. Things get more complicated when a mysterious couple comes looking for Chi. Might she be more than an average computer servant? Clamp is an all-female manga-creating team whose feminine touch shows in this entertaining, sci-fi soap opera. Besides a plot revolving around personal drama, the art style borrows from the Japanese romance genre, where girls have huge doe eyes and long, flowing hair, and fuzzy, florid backdrops frame sentimental moments. Clamp excels at multiple manga styles, transitioning through realistic establishment panels of urban scenes, the cartoony explosions of facial expressions in comedic moments and science fiction and romance. Presenting the work in original right-to-left format, TokyoPop has also left in the Japanese sound effects that are integral to the art, carefully embedding drawn-to-match English translations within the frame. The result is impressively unobtrusive, if occasionally difficult to read. But discerning young manga fans will appreciate the attention to such details. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cromwell - Our Chief of Men</h2><p>Physical description; xx, 774 p., [32] p. of plates : ill., ports. ; 24 cm.

A nationally known science teacher, Ms. Markle also authored the award-winning <b>Animal Predator</b> and <b>Animal Scavenger</b> series for Lerner Publications. She lives in New Zealand with her husband.&#x201c;It is truly an insect&#x2019;s world.&#x201d; Veteran science writer Markle&#x2019;s enthusiasm for her subject energizes this title about praying mantises that moves from a general summary of insect characteristics to the specifics of mantis anatomy, characteristics, and life cycle. Young readers will be drawn in by the animated tone (&#x201c;The praying mantis reaches out fast. Gotcha!&#x201d;), the numerous &#x201c;fast fact&#x201d; boxes, and the startling full-color, close-up photos of the insect in all its life stages; a shot of a mantis shedding its exoskeleton is particularly vivid. A glossary closes the book, but many concepts and terms are defined within the lively text. Some kids may need help with a few cursory references, such as those to animal classifications, but this well-written and illustrated entry in the Insect World series will find wide use in elementary science classes and as a personal reading choice for budding young entomologists.

First published in 1986, Peretti's book set a suspenseful standard in spiritual warfare story-telling that has rarely been met by his contemporaries. Set in the apparently innocent small town of Ashton, <i>This Present Darkness</i> follows an intrepid born-again Christian preacher and newspaper reporter as they unearth a New Age plot to take over the local community and eventually the entire world. Nearly every page of the book describes sulfur-breathing, black-winged, slobbering demons battling with tall, handsome, angelic warriors on a level of reality that is just beyond the senses. However, Christian believers and New Age demon-worshippers are able to influence unseen clashes between good and evil by the power of prayer. Peretti's violent descriptions of exorcisms are especially vivid: "There were fifteen [demons], packed into Carmen's body like crawling, superimposed maggots, boiling, writhing, a tangle of hideous arms, legs, talons, and heads." This book is not for the squeamish. But for page-turning spiritual suspense, it's hard to beat.<p><strong>Frank E. Peretti</strong> is one of American Christianity's best-known authors. His novels have sold over 10 million copies, and he is widely credited with reinventing Christian fiction.

The sex part! According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, Madonna tried to insure her breasts for $6 million each. Prince dumped her because "he wanted to savor every second [of sex]; she was into multiple orgasms." Sean Penn demanded she get an HIV test. "Screw you," she said. "Not until you get tested," he said. When Penn found out about Madonna and Prince, he punched a hole in her wall. Madonna demanded that Prince plaster it ("You're responsible!"), and he did. JFK Jr. refused to give her a baby, and Jackie objected to his affair with someone called a "Material Girl." "Who in this world has been more materialistic than you?" JFK Jr. asked his mother. When he and Madonna dumped each other, he said, "Easy come, easy go." She compared her Broadway debut in <i>Speed-the-Plow</i> to "having really good sex." After their first kiss, Warren Beatty said, "Houston, we have lift-off." Madonna's tune "Hanky Panky" reflects Beatty's favorite sport, spanking. But Barbra Streisand helped convince him to dump the "floozy," so she picked up Tony Ward on Malibu Beach by putting out a cigarette on his back and pinching his nipple. When she realized he was more of a floozy than she was, she spent 21 and a half hours in the Carlyle Hotel trying to convince the married Penn to father her child. Rebuffed, she picked up Carlos Leon, a fitness trainer at Crunch, in Central Park, and presto, she had a baby. Dennis Rodman (whom she called "Daddy Long Legs") was a dud in bed, but she found true love in the daddy of her second child, Princess Diana's cousin Guy Ritchie, director of <i>Snatch</i>. <p> There's stuff about her career in the book, but Taraborrelli is a lousy music and film critic. I can't vouch for the accuracy of his dish, but I promise you that as a gossip he's the real thing. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>J.

His <i>Amazon Beaming</i> and <i>Almost Adam</i> were international bestsellers, while his autobiography <i>The Return</i> received high critical acclaim. He is married to Mirek and Blanka's daughter Iris and they have two children, Chloe and Adam. <p> Mirek and Blanka live near the Popescus in Beverly Hills, California.</p>With historical sweep and accuracy, and a happy ending, this unique Holocaust memoir simultaneously elicits thrills and disquietude. Novelist and memoirist Popescu (Amazon Beaming) has rewritten the memoirs of his parents-in-law, Mirek Friedman and Blanka Davidovich, and fashioned their story of falling in love during and marrying after WWII into a cohesive narrative of interspersed first-person chapters. Their individual stories are unique and riveting: Blanka moved through various camps and job assignments, witnessing horror, enduring separation from her family and finding safety in carefully and continually breaking rules and asserting herself. Mirek, a political prisoner and an able technician who managed to keep his real Jewish identity hidden, survived the camps by doing maintenance work and defusing bombs for the SS. Their descriptions of their affair, conducted under excruciating circumstances, makes palpable their hope of surviving to make a future together. The drama unfurls intently and powerfully, filled with significant moments and insights Blanka's remembrances and contemplation of shtetl life; Mirek's attempt to smuggle a radio into the camp that gets him interrogated. In an afterword, Popescu explains how he searched for a narrative voice that would encompass both of his subjects (as well as his other background research); yet because of his curious, rather novelistic construction, Blanka's and Mirek's voices seem disconcertingly uniform. But by the end, their valor and their enthralling, remarkable determination to shape their own fates supersedes any distracting stylistic flaws. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Possessive Investment In Whiteness</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Richards: His Life and Work</h2><p>Traces the life, theories, and works of author and critic Richards, renowned for his involvement in literacy and language training, as well as his later-life poetry and plays</p><p>Ivor Armstrong Richards (1893-1979) was one of the most influential modern literary critics, so this first biography of the puckish Cambridge don who turned lit-crit upside-down is welcome. A tubercular child traumatized by his father's early death, Richards pulled himself together by climbing mountains, a sport he pursued well into his 80s. But the real drama lies in his invention of an analytical method capable of tackling the poems of Eliot, Pound and Stevens, the experimental prose of Joyce, Faulkner, Mann, Proust. Today, Richards' name is somewhat misleadingly associated with the New Critics who, like him, downplayed writers' personal lives and historical contexts, treating each poem or novel as a self-contained work. As Russo (who was a close acquaintance of Richards) convincingly argues, the New Critics cut him down to their own size, rejecting his liberalism and his embrace of modern science. Richards borrowed freely from Chinese thought, Darwinism, neuroscience and behaviorism to suit his purposes. A self-styled anarchist, he believed, with Shelley, that, given the right programs and poetry, "the world's great age begins anew." Challenging the reader with fresh insights, this magnificent biography is a tour de force and a reappraisal of the critical enterprise of our times. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Richards's work in literary criticism is at the root of the "new" criticism and one of the foundations of modern critical thought. His thinking on the theory and practice of communication is a similarly groundbreaking effort. While Russo provides considerable information on Richards's life and 60-year career, theprimary focus of this "intellectual biography" is the origin and development of his thought, its key themes, biases, and relationship to ideas of other thinkers. (Richards, who shunned biography in criticism, would have approved.)

My name is Tom Wallace; I work in Publications at the North American Aircraft plant in Inglewood, California. We were living in Hawthorne, renting a two-bedroom tract house owned by one of our next-door neighbors, Mildred Sentas. Another neighbor, Frank Wanamaker, and I usually drove to and from the plant together, alternating cars. But Frank didn't like Saturday work and had managed to beg off that particular day. So I drove home alone.<br>As I turned onto Tulley Street, I saw the '51 Mercury coupe parked in front of our house and knew that Anne's brother, Philip, was visiting. He was a psychology major at the University of California in Berkeley and he sometimes drove down to L.A. for weekends. This was the first time he'd been to our new place; we'd only moved in two months before.<br>I nosed the Ford into the driveway and braked it in front of the garage. Across the street Frank Wanamaker's wife, Elizabeth, was sitting on their lawn pulling up weeds. She smiled faintly at me and raised one white-gloved hand. I waved to her as I got out of the car and started for the porch. As I went up its two steps I saw Elizabeth struggle to her feet and adjust her maternity smock. The baby was due in about three months. It was the Wanamaker's first in seven years of marriage.<br>When I opened the front door and went into the living room, I saw Phil sitting at the kitchen table, a bottle of Coca-Cola in front of him. He was about twenty, tall and lean, his darkish-brown hair crew-cut. He glanced in at me and grinned.<br>"Hi, brother man," he said.<br>"Hi." I took off my suit coat and hung it in the front closet. Anne met me in the kitchen doorway with a smile and a kiss.<br>"How's the little mother?" I asked, patting her stomach.<br>"Gross," she said.<br>I chuckled and kissed her again.<br>"As they say," I said, "hot enough for you?"<br>"Don't even talk about it," she answered.<br>"Okay."<br>"Hungry?" she asked.<br>"Ravenous."<br>"Good. Phil and I were just about to start."<br>"Be right with you." I washed my hands and sat down across from Phil, eyeing his blindingly green polo shirt.<br>"What's that for," I asked, "warning off aircraft?"<br>"Glows in the dark," he said.<br>"Helps the co-eds keep track of you at night," I said. Phil grinned.<br>"Now don't you two get started again," Anne said, putting a dish of cold cuts on the table.<br>"Whatever does you mean?" Phil said to her.<br>"Never mind now," she said. "I don't want any needling session this weekend. It's too hot."<br>"Agreed," said Phil, "needling excluded. Agreed, brother man?"<br>"And spoil my weekend?" I said.<br>"Never mind," said Anne. "I can't face that and the heat both."<br>"Where's Richard?" I asked.<br>"Playing in the backyard with Candy." Anne sat down beside me with a groan. "There's a load off my feet," she said.<br>I patted her hand and we started eating.<br>"Speaking of Candy," Anne said, "I trust you haven't forgotten the party tonight at Elsie's."<br>"Oh my God," I said, "I did forget. Do we have to go?"<br>Anne shrugged. "She invited us a week ago. That was excuse time. It's too late now."<br>"Confusion." I bit into my ham on rye.<br>"Brother man seems less than joyous," Phil said. "Elsie's shindigs no goo'?"<br>"No goo'," I said.<br>"Who is she?"<br>"Our next-door neighbor," Anne told him. "Candy's her little girl."<br>"And parties are her profession," I said. "She's the poor man's Elsa Maxwell."<br>Anne smiled and shook her head. "Poor Elsie," she said. "If she only knew what awful things we say behind her back."<br>"Dull, huh?" said Phil.<br>"Why talk?" I said. "Go to the party with us and see for yourself."<br>"I'll liven 'er up," said Phil.<br>* * *<br>A little after eight-fifteen Richard fell asleep in his crib and we went next door to Elsie's house. In most marriages you think of a couple's home as <i>theirs</i>. Not so with that house. Ron may have made the payments on it but the ownership was strictly Elsie's. You felt it.<br>It was Ron who answered our knock. He was twenty-four, a couple of years older than Elsie, a couple of inches taller. He was slightly built, sandy-haired with a round, boyish face that seldom lost its impassive set; even when he smiled as he did then, the ends of his mouth curling up slightly.<br>"Come in," he said in his quiet, polite voice.<br>Frank and Elizabeth were already there, Elizabeth settled on the red sofa like a diffident patient in a dentist's waiting room, Frank's thin body slouched in one of the red arm chairs. He brightened only a little when we came in, raising his bored gaze from the green rug, straightening up in the chair, then standing. I introduced Phil around.<br>"Hi!"<br>I glanced over and saw Elsie peering around the corner of the kitchen doorway. She'd cut her dark hair still shorter and bobbed it still tighter, I noticed. When we'd moved into the neighborhood, she'd had long, drabby blond hair.<br>We all said hello to her and she disappeared a moment, then came into the room with a tray of drinks in her hands. She was wearing a red, netlike dress which clung tightly to the curves of her plump body. When she bent over to put the tray down on the blondwood coffee table, the bosom of the dress slipped away from her tight, black brassiere. I noticed Frank's pointed stare, then Elsie straightened up with a brassy, hostesslike smile and looked at Phil. Anne introduced them.<br>"Hel-<i>lo</i>," Elsie said. "I'm so glad you could come." She looked at us. "Well," she said, "name your poison."<br>What happened that evening up to the point when it all began is not important. There were the usual peregrinations to the kitchen and the bathroom; the usual breaking up and re-gathering of small groups--the women, the men, Frank, Phil and myself, Elizabeth and Anne, Elsie and Phil, Ron and me--and so on; the drifting knots of conversation that take place at any get-together.<br>There was record music and a little sporadic attempt at dancing. There was Candy stumbling into the living room, blinking and numb with only half-broken sleep; being tucked back into her bed. There were the expected personality displays--Frank, cynical and bored; Elizabeth, quietly radiant in her pregnancy; Phil, amusing and quick; Ron, mute and affable; Anne, soft-spoken and casual; Elsie, bouncing and strainedly vivacious.<br>One bit of conversation I remember: I was just about to go next door to check on Richard when Elsie said something about our getting a baby-sitter.<br>"It doesn't matter when you just go next door like this," she said, "but you do have to get out once in a while." Once in a while, to Elsie, meant an average of four nights a week.<br>"We'd like to," Anne said, "but we just haven't been able to find one."<br>"Try ours," said Elsie. "She's a nice kid and real reliable."<br>That was when I left and checked on Richard--and had one of my many nighttime adorations; that standing in semi-darkness over your child's crib and staring down at him. Nothing else. Just standing there and staring down at his little sleep-flushed face and feeling that almost overwhelming rush of absolute love in yourself. Sensing something close to holy in the same little being that nearly drove you out of your mind that very afternoon.<br>I turned up the heat a little then and went back to Elsie's house.<br>They were talking about hypnotism. I say <i>they</i> but, outside of Phil, Anne and maybe Frank, no one there knew the least thing about it. Primarily, it was a dissertation by Phil on one of his favorite topics.<br>"Oh, I don't believe that," Elsie said as I sat down beside Anne and whispered that Richard was fine. "People who say they were hypnotized weren't, really."<br>"Of course they were," Phil said. "If they weren't, how could they have hatpins jabbed into their throats without bleeding? Without even crying out?"<br>Elsie turned her head halfway to the side and looked at Phil in that overdone, accusingly dubious way that people affect when they have to bolster their own uncertain doubts.<br>"Did you ever <i>really</i> see anyone get a hatpin jabbed in their throat?" she said.<br>"I've had a five-inch hatpin in my throat," Phil answered. "And, once, I put one halfway through a friend of mine's arm at school--after I'd hypnotized him."<br>Elsie shuddered histrionically. "<i>Uhh</i>," she said, "how <i>awful</i>."<br>"Not at all," Phil said with that casual tone undergraduates love to affect when they are flicking off intellectual bombshells. "I didn't feel a thing and neither did my friend."<br>"Oh, you're just making that up," Elsie said, studiedly disbelieving.<br>"Not at all," said Phil.<br>It was Frank who gave it the final, toppling push.<br>"All right," he said, "let's see you hypnotize somebody then." He squeezed out one of his faintly cruel smiles. "Hypnotize Elsie," he said.<br>"Oh, no you don't!" Elsie squealed. "I'm not going to do terrible things in front of everybody."<br>"I thought you didn't believe in it," Phil said, amusedly.<br>"I don't, I don't," she insisted. "But...well, not <i>me</i>."<br>Frank's dark eyes moved. "All right," he said, "who's going to be hypnotized?"<br>"I wouldn't suggest me unless we want to spend the whole night here," Anne said. "Phil used to waste hours trying to hypnotize me."<br>"You're a lousy subject, that's all," Phil said, grinning at her.<br>"Okay, who's it gonna be then?" Frank persisted. "How about you, Lizzie?"<br>"Oh... " Elizabeth lowered her eyes and smiled embarrassedly.<br>"We promise not to make you take your clothes off," Frank said.<br>"<i>Frank</i>." Elizabeth was thirty-one but she still blushed like a little girl. She wouldn't look at anybody. Elsie giggled. Frank looked only vaguely pleased. Elizabeth was too easy a mark for him.<br>"Come on, Elsie," he said, "be a sport. Let him put you under. We won't make you do a strip tease on the kitchen table."<br>"You--" Ron started to say.<br>"Oh, you're awful!" Elsie said, delighted.<br>"What were you going to say, Ron?" I asked.<br>Ron swallowed. "I--I was going to ask Phil," he said, "you--can't make someone--do what they don't want to do, can you? I mean--what they <i>wouldn't</i> do? If they were awake, I mean."<br>"Oh, what do <i>you</i> know about hypnotism, Ronny?" Elsie asked, trying to sound pleasantly amused. The acidity still came through.<br>"Well, it's true and it isn't true," Phil said. "You can't make a subject break his own moral code. <i>But</i>--you can make almost any act fit into his moral code."<br>"How do you mean?" Frank asked. "This sounds promising."<br>"Well, for instance," Phil said, "if I hypnotized your wife--"<br>"You could make her do something <i>wicked</i>!" Frank asked, looking at Elizabeth pointedly.<br>"Frank, please," she almost whispered.<br>"Say I put a loaded gun in her hand," Phil said, "and told her to shoot you. She wouldn't do it."<br>"That's what you think," Frank said, snickering. I looked at Elizabeth again and saw her swallowing dryly. She was one of those pale and pitiable creatures who seem constantly vulnerable to hurt. You want to protect them and yet you can't. Of course Frank wasn't the easiest man in the world to live with either.<br>"Well, for argument's sake," Phil said, smiling a little, "we'll assume she wouldn't shoot you."<br>"Okay, for argument's sake," Frank said. He glanced at Elizabeth, a hint of that cruel smile on his lips again.<br>"<i>But</i>," Phil said, "if I were to tell Elizabeth that you were going to strangle her and told her that the only defense in the world she had was to shoot you right away--well, she might very well shoot you."<br>"How true," said Frank.<br>"Oh, I don't believe that," said Elsie.<br>"That's right," I joined in. "We have a friend named Alan Porter--he's a psychiatrist--and he gave a demonstration of that very thing. He had a young mother under hypnosis and he told her he was going to kill her baby and the only way she could stop him was by stabbing him with the knife she was holding--it was a piece of cardboard. She stabbed him all right."<br>"Well, that's different," said Elsie. "Anyway, she was probably just playing along with a gag."<br>&nbsp;"Look," said Phil, gesturing dramatically with his hands, "I'll prove it to you right now if you want. Just let me hypnotize you."<br>"No, <i>sir</i>," said Elsie, "not me."<br>"How about you?" Phil asked Ron.<br>Ron mumbled something and shook his head with a faint smile. "He's already half hypnotized," said Elsie, kindly.<br>"Can't I get me a customer?" asked Phil. He sounded disappointed.<br>"How about you, Frank?" I asked.<br>"Uh-uh," he said, smiling as he blew out cigarette smoke. "Don't want ol' Lizzie knowing what's in my dirty old subconscious."<br>Elsie giggled and Elizabeth pressed her lips together, having failed in the attempt to smile.<br>"Well, that leaves you, brother man," said Phil, looking at me.<br>"You don't really think you could hypnotize <i>me</i>, do you?" I needled.<br>"Don't be so darn sure," he said, wagging a finger at me. "You arrogant ones are the first to topple."<br>I grinned, shrugging. "So what have I got to lose?" I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1958 by Richard Matheson, renewed 1986 by Richard</p><h2>America the Beautiful: The Stirring True Story Behind Our Nation&#39;s Favorite Song</h2><p>We&#39;ve all sung it a thousand times, and most of us know at least the first verse by heart. &#34;America the Beautiful&#34; has been called a hymn, a prayer, even the &#34;national heartbeat set to music.&#34; Numerous proposals and half a dozen bills in Congress have tried to replace our national anthem, &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#34; with this more lyrical, less militaristic song. But who knows the story behind the song? In America the Beautiful, Lynn Sherr tells the story of Katharine Lee Bates, a poet and pioneering young English professor at the newly established Wellesley College, who penned &#34;America the Beautiful&#34; at age 33, as she gazed over the glorious panorama from the top of Pike&#39;s Peak, Colorado. The poem, published two years later on July 4, 1895, struck a chord. Americans embraced it and immediately set it to music, trying out at least 74 different melodies. There were even Mexican, Canadian, and Australian versions. Analyzing the lyrics of &#34;America the Beautiful&#34; and the story of Katharine Lee Bates&#39;s unusual life, Lynn Sherr opens a window onto the shifting world of late 19th century America. She explores the lingering impact of the Civil War and the dramatic developments in commerce and technology, which shaped the American Century and the popularity of one brilliant, stirring song.</p><p><b>Lynn Sherr</b>, correspondent for <i>ABC News 20/20</i> , has written books on several subjects about which she is passionate, including <i>Tall Blondes: A Book About Giraffes</i> and <i>Failure is Impossible: Susan B. Anthony in her Own Words</i> . She lives in New York City.Adult/High School-This attractive book tells of Katherine Lee Bates's journeys preceding and following the writing of "America the Beautiful." Scherr brings a visual as well as literary focus to the story of this song, which has evolved into an unofficial national anthem, especially since the tragic attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Bates was an English professor at Wellesley College and a prolific poet and scholar, but she will always be remembered for contributing much to the patriotic feelings of both her times and ours. In understated prose and evocative illustrations, the author transports readers back to the not-so-halcyon days at the turn of the last century and the not always graceful coming-of-age of the United States. The history of the anthem from poem to icon is clearly traced while the times are brought to life in plentiful period illustrations and photographs, both in color and black and white; posters; song sheets; facsimiles; and maps. This book might be useful for history, music, literature, or sociology assignments, but it is also a joy to look through and to read for pure interest.<br><i>Susan H.

He has worked for the BBC, Ireland&#x2019;s Ardmore Studios, and PBS as a writer, producer, and director of television dramas and documentaries. He lives in Dublin, Ireland.Robert Redford&#x2019;s early life was dominated by women. They were not the women of New England, but women of the West. His mother, Martha Hart Redford, was, he says, the center of his universe. She taught him to drive when he was eight, taught him to draw, to role-play in games. She connected him with the past, introducing him to Native Americans on Navajo reservations in Arizona and to Yosemite. These conjunctions came naturally to her, because she was the stuff of the West, descended from Texans who were, in spirit, the polar opposite of the Redfords. A century before, the Harts and Greens of the maternal family line lived a frontier life along the Mississippi Valley, religiously random, indulgent, drifting. The Harts were Galway-Irish, the Greens Scots-Irish, and both families came to America through the southern colonies in the mid-eighteenth century. The Harts followed the frontier to Missouri; the Greens followed the money to Boston. While the Harts drifted, the Greens built one of the first large-scale printing presses in Boston in 1790. When a similarly ambitious undertaking in Arkansas failed, George Green set out with his family by wagon train in 1853 to settle lands near Austin, Texas. Along with three partners, he founded a new town called San Marcos. In no time George, a slave owner, had established mining interests and a loan company. His son, Edwin Jeremiah, known to all as Ed, was twelve when they set up in Texas. By the age of twenty he had expanded the family&#x2019;s businesses into every variety of service provision for miners across the region. He also built Green&#x2019;s Anglican Church next door to the family bank. During his service in the Confederate army, young Ed&#x2019;s wife died and he married her sister, Eliza Jane, who bore him six children, including Eugene, Robert Redford&#x2019;s maternal great-grandfather. As San Marcos&#x2019;s fortunes grew during Reconstruction, Ed became a legendary figure, a titan of the local business world. Among his social circle was another celebrated ex&#x2013;Confederate officer, Zachariah P. Bugg, the sheriff of a Tennessee township. Zach&#x2019;s daughter Mattie married Eugene in 1891. Out of this union came Sallie Pate Green, Robert Redford&#x2019;s grandmother. <br><br>Sallie Pate&#x2019;s childhood was one of privilege and tragedy. Eugene Green followed his father into mining and banking, but died suddenly at twenty, when his daughter was just months old. Shortly after, his teenage widow, Mattie, died of typhoid. Ed became de facto father to Sallie and rechristened her Mattie, in memory of her mother. She was the apple of his eye. In 1896, when Sallie was three, Ed&#x2019;s wife passed away. Shortly afterward he married Alice Young Bohan, a recently widowed sister of his former wives. Alice was affectionate but not maternal, and Ed was sixty-five; it was Sallie&#x2019;s good fortune that the black wet nurse, Nicey, a Green household fixture since her own childhood, became an affectionate substitute mother.&nbsp; <br><br>In 1909, as Sallie turned sixteen, America&#x2019;s fascination with the new automotive culture, started ten years before by Henry Ford, was peaking. That fall, Sallie attended a county fair advertising a race for custom roadsters, one of dozens held across the country. The race was won by the Bluebird, the handiwork of a shoe salesman turned inventor/mechanic, recently arrived from El Paso, named Tot Hart. Having won the attention of Sallie and the rest of the Green family, he was invited by them&nbsp; <br>to dinner.&nbsp; <br><br>Archibald &#x201c;Tot&#x201d; Hart was, like the Greens, of a western cut. His father, John Gabriel, was a traveling salesman from Spotsylvania, Virginia, who married an Ohioan, Ida Woodruff, in Missouri in 1885. In 1897, when Tot was eight, his father succumbed to cirrhosis, dying at the side of the road, and two years later his mother lay on her deathbed, urging her sons to pledges of temperance. Foster homes were found for Tot and his brother. Tot was small, but he had the energy of a terrier and liked the notion of risk. As with his father before him, the frontier beckoned. He headed south with nothing but the clothes he walked in, he later told Redford.&nbsp; <br><br>In the years that followed, Tot learned the survival skills he would ultimately pass on to Robert Redford. &#x201c;He was a modern mountain man,&#x201d; Redford recalls. &#x201c;He was a child when he hit the road, but it was do or die. He took work wherever he could find it, and learned to live off the land, hunting small game and harvesting berries. He loved the outdoors, but he also possessed a great gift with mechanical devices. Because he had to, he learned to build. He could build anything: furniture, boats, guns, even automobiles from scratch. He followed fifty trades, whatever paid for a crust of bread.&#x201d;<br>Tot fell for Sallie. It was the unlikeliest of marriages. Tot was dwarfish beside the mannequin figure of Sallie. His coloring was mousy and weatherbeaten; hers, a pampered tan.He had no education; she had good schooling behindher. Hewasquiet; she was talkative, vain, sociable.But their common bond was ambition. Surviving on the edge, Tot had become foxy and tenacious.<br>Years of traveling and scheming had honed his ambition: to build houses and cities on the edge of the frontier. The Greens and their connections afforded him a supreme opportunity. Sallie understood this. Rooted in Texas after their 1913 marriage,Tot began to build. With Ed&#x2019;s help, Tot constructed a Prairie-style home on the shores of Lake Austin at Travis Heights that became the blueprint for a community of homes by the lake built over the next ten years.<br><br>On April 12, 1914, Sallie gave birth to their only child, Martha, and their fortunes seemed secure. But almost immediately, through bad partnerships and failing health, Ed Green&#x2019;s empire began to slide. The properties Tot labored over failed to sell. Sallie began to drink. By the 1920s she was all but incapacitated as an alcoholic, and Tot was seeking comfort in the company of other women. Ed Green&#x2019;s death in 1924 devastated Sallie, but it was nothing compared with the humiliation of Tot&#x2019;s relationship with Mary P. Robinson, a well-heeled neighbor who flaunted their affair.<br><br>In the midst of her alcoholic despair Sallie experienced a religious conversion. &#x201c;The doctor said, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s it, there&#x2019;s nothing anyone can do for her,&#x2019; &#x201d; Redford recalls his mother telling him. &#x201c;Then, at the last minute, someone recommended this Christian Science woman doctor down the street who could work miracles. This woman was summoned, and gave Sallie the literature that changed her world. It was like a light switch. Sallie got out of bed, stopped drinking and swore never to touch liquor again, and she never did.&#x201d;<br><br>After six months&#x2019; separation,Tot and Salliewere divorced in June 1928. In search of a newbeginning, Sallie daringly decided on the faraway pastures of California, where some cousins lived. Armed with telephone numbers and a few hundred dollars from the settlement, Sallie and thirteen-year-old Martha headed west.<br>The Redfords, meanwhile, had also begun the move west. Ten years before, Elisha&#x2019;s granddaughter Grace, disenchanted with the increasingly anarchist movement headed by her hero Emma Goldman, landed a teaching post in Los Angeles, leaving her sister teaching in the dull confines of a ramshackle school in the heart of the most impoverished area. Elisha was dead by then, but the fabric of security he had sought to weave was rapidly coming undone. Charles had become a deadbeat, preferring his music, or a day at the bar, to barbering. Eventually he would become an insurance salesman. Charles Elijah had drifted into vaudeville. Redford remembers Charles Elijah as &#x201c;Tiger,&#x201d; a wry moniker derived from his sandy complexion and grumbling persona. They grew close late in Tiger&#x2019;s life, and Redford viewed the old man as a stubborn introvert whose emotions never surfaced. For Tiger, Redford believes, vaudeville was not an indulgence, but an escape to a rosier life. Business and industry had variables, but given its scope, vaudeville seemed a sure thing. All across the East, theaters were flourishing. Composers, lyricists and music publishers were rolling in dough. Tin Pan Alley was a boomtown, and the talent-packaging houses of William Morris, Klaw and Erlanger and Keith-Albee could hardly keep pace with audience demand. Tiger&#x2019;s violin skills were such that a wealthy Westerly patron had offered him sponsorship for the Conservatoire in Vienna, but vaudeville seemed to him like the better bet. &#x201c;I have a picture in my head,&#x201d; says Redford, &#x201c;of the terrible drabness of life for immigrants from Europe, the financial struggles, the political and religious tensions. And then vaudeville comes to town in the painted tent. Suddenly there are people with greasepaint faces and funny hats. Suddenly there is laughter! I have an image of Tiger on his knees, lifting the edge of some circus tarpaulin, peeping into a happier world. No more struggle. No more stress. Freedom!&#x201d; Tiger easily found a place in the orchestral pits of the B. F. Keith circuit, where he earned $7.50 a week in 1910, the year the Marx Brothers, then billed as theMarks Brothers, set forth on the same circuit.<br><br>In 1911 Tiger married Cornish-born textile worker Lena Taylor, whose grandmother came from Kircubbin, County Down, in Ireland. She was six feet tall, a good eight inches more than Tiger, and had a loud Irish manner and a booming voice. But she was no match for Tiger&#x2019;s stubbornness. The newlyweds settled into a rented wooden home in the Irish-Italian section of neighboring Westerly, across the Pawcatuck River. On November 19, 1914, a son, once again named Charles, was born, followed by David George on March 5, 1918. Now Tiger struggled to keep up. Bigtime success evaded him, and he was an increasingly absent husband and father, chasing the expanding Keith circuit through the Midwest, eking out a few bucks in the pits while a jokey fiddle player named Ben Kubelsky&#x2014;soon to be rechristened Jack Benny&#x2014;burned up the center stage, earning $350 a week. When he was at home, his wife&#x2019;s severe rheumatoid arthritis complicated matters. Travel took its toll, too. In his memoirs Jack Benny described the Keith treadmill as &#x201c;constant getting on a train, getting off a train, carrying your bags to the cheapest hotel or boardinghouse, running to the theater, running, playing three, four, five shows a day, smiling when you faced the audience, taking your bow and<br>fighting all the time for a better place on the bill.&#x201d; Sometime in the midtwenties, a couple of years before the end of vaudeville, Tiger retired to part-time violin teaching and occasional silent movie accompaniments at the Garde and Capitol theaters in New London, Connecticut. Five years later he unstrung his fiddles, carefully draped them with burial sheets and never touched them again.<br><br>Under Lena&#x2019;s influence Tiger assumed a Fenian sensibility, humming &#x201c;Danny Boy&#x201d; and sharing Lena&#x2019;s oft- repeated tales of the heroic emergence of the Irish Free State. Much of his neighborhood, however, was immersed in Italian ways. Since the 1890s, floods of indigent Italians from Calabria and Sicily had populated ghettos that overspread the well-established Irish communities. Tiger was happy among the Italians, but he also sought out the Irish drinking community and was at home among the old guard. &#x201c;Once he settled, all the family became Republican Irish,&#x201d; says Redford. &#x201c;I think it was a progression of his personal inbuilt rebelliousness.&#x201d; Rebellion was certainly apparent in the next generation of Redfords. The young boys, Charlie and David, were good students, but they were intoxicated by the Jazz Age. They stayed out too late too often and were punished for it. David made adjustments, finally kowtowing to a disciplined school life. But Charlie stayed wild, reveling in his natural athleticism and a rapier wit like Tiger&#x2019;s. In many ways the boys were unalike. David was tall and black haired like Lena; Charlie was smaller and sandy haired. David seemed to make peace with himself early on; Charlie remained irascible. Tiger foresaw trouble, and it wasn&#x2019;t long in coming. At fourteen Charlie started a relationship with an Italian bargirl that caused controversy in the neighborhood and embarrassment for Lena, who was now wheelchair- bound. Tiger wrote in desperation to his sister in Los Angeles. The only option, he said, was to get Charlie out of town. Grace, now living and teaching at Morocco Junction, just five miles from Hollywood, agreed. Charlie Redford was going west.<br>On a hot spring Sunday in 1928, fourteen-year-old George Menard, a transplanted Chicagoan, grew bored with morning services at the Fourth Street Christian Science Church in Santa Monica and sneaked out. He spotted a parked Model T on fire, grabbed a garden hose, lifted the hood and doused the engine. &#x201c;A couple of minutes later,&#x201d; rememberedMenard, &#x201c;church let out and this dark apparition sailed toward me, about thirteen or fourteen years old, with an older lady by her side. It was their automobile<br>I&#x2019;d rescued, and they were grateful and so began a great friendship.&#x201d; The pretty girl that Menard admired was Martha Hart, and the woman was her mother, Sallie, just arrived from Texas. Martha had enrolled at University High School in West Los Angeles. Menard&#x2019;s sister Poofie had enrolled at the same school and would shortly become Martha&#x2019;s best school friend. George, operating in a different social circle, would coincidentally become best friends with a new arrival from the East Coast named Charlie Redford, who also attended Uni High. &#x201c;But at that moment I wasn&#x2019;t thinking what a great match she&#x2019;d make for someone else,&#x201d; said<br>Menard. &#x201c;I was thinking I&#x2019;d like her for myself.&#x201d;<br><br>In later years, Redford learned from hismother about her smooth transition into Californian life. &#x201c;When Texas came to California, it was a big deal,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Sallie had renewed her health, and she was determined to reinvent herself as a social butterfly.Mymother was naturally fun loving and extroverted, so they were on the right wavelength and in the right place.&#x201d; Sallie contacted her cousins, theWards and the Giesens&#x2014;old San Marcos settler families&#x2014;who were well- heeled regulars in the society columns. Sallie&#x2019;s uncle Phil, a transplanted Chicagoan who had the Packard dealership in Beverly Hills, became a surrogate father to Martha. Phil&#x2019;s wife, Marge, was the sister of up- and- comingHollywood actor Robert Young.<br><br>Though Tot sent money and maintained a strangely passionate commitment to both mother and daughter, Sallie had met Nelson Bengston, a man who exuded an aura of calm and reserve, the apparent antithesis of Tot. Bengston had turned from defense work to real estate during the Depression, but he was, says Robert Redford, a frustrated artist who was also a recovering alcoholic. The couple met at the Christian Science church: a shared belief in the curative power of religion bonded them, and, says Redford, their harmonious relationship allowed Martha&#x2019;s confidence to grow.<br><br>At Uni High, Martha thrived. She joined the glee club, the drama society, the writers&#x2019; club. Judging by her school reports and the memories of those who knew her, she didn&#x2019;t so much rise to popularity as to reverence. She had the face and figure of a movie star and reminded people of Gene Tierney. She loved poetry and singing. She kept scrupulous scrapbooks, which reveal page after page of theatrical ca...</p><h2>Teks Interactive Student Guide - Texas Algebra 1</h2><p>Student Workbook for the NEW McGraw Hill Texas Algebra Curriculum.</p><p></p><h2>The Golden Egg Book (Big Little Golden Book)</h2><p><b>A Golden classic about a bunny&#x2014;and a little duck that is about to hatch!<br><br></b>Once there was a little bunny.

Families in town soon realize that like her great-aunt, Missy Piggle-Wiggle has inventive cures for all sorts of childhood (mis)behavior: The Whatever Cure and the Just-a-Minute Cure, for instance.

He lives and works in the Shenandoah Valley with his wife and their boisterous pack of daughters.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;In the classic "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle" series, the title character "cured" children of annoying habits without belittling them. By helping the children see how others were affected by their behavior, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle taught empathy in a humorous manner. The tradition lives on in Missy, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's red-headed great-niece. Having spent time with her aunt as a child, Missy learned to make magic potions and spells. She also absorbed her aunt's kind approach to child psychology. Called to take care of the upside-down house and pets while Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is away, Missy must form her own relationships with the inhabitants of Little Spring Valley. The initial exposition drags a bit. In an attempt to bridge the new book with the old, three chapters are devoted to Missy's arrival and her introduction to the town. The pace picks up when the cures begin. Parents are concerned about greediness, tardiness, and procrastination. They would like their children to stop being spies, know-it-alls, and gum-smackers. With thoughtfulness and patience as well as magic gumdrops, bubbles, and a noisy watch, Missy helps improve the situations. Martin adds depth to the story by using one family, the Freeforalls, as a unifying thread throughout the narrative. Work-focused Mr. and Mrs. Freeforall need some Piggle-Wiggle assistance as much as their three children do. Although modernized in many ways, the tale, like its predecessors, relies on the premise of a small, mostly white town where parents let their children roam freely during the day. Hatke ("Zita the Spacegirl"; Julia's House for Lost Creatures; Little Robot) provides charming cover and black-and-white interior illustrations.

Son of actor Keenan Wynn and grandson of comedian Ed Wynn, the author was four when his parents divorced and his mother married Van Johnson, then a reigning star. Growing up, Wynn was alienated from his father, felt deprived in the midst of the opulence provided by his stepfather and unworthy in the company of family friends like Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor et al. Tales of glittering folk abound in the book, but none compare with the author's own and his recollections of his father, the "leading man's best friend," i.e., Johnson. Not only was his father betrayed by Johnson, his best friend, but all were ultimately done in when, in turn, the leading man abandoned Ned and his mother, leaving them broke, and took off with his male lover. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.The author, son of Keenan Wynn, grandson of Ed Wynn, and stepson of Van Johnson, writes an often bitter and cynical account of growing up in Hollywood. A substance abuser at an early age, he describes his aimless, self-indulgent life. The narrative is sometimes confused, but the general effect is one of catharsis: as the story progresses, Wynn begins to take responsibility for his life rather than blaming others for his problems. Though not an essential purchase, the book may appeal to those who are fascinated by the dark side of fame. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 7/1/90.<br><i>- Barbara E. Kemp, Columbia Univ.

They wish to forget that, as Euro-Americans invaded North America and prospered in the "New World," the numbers of native peoples declined sharply; entire tribes, often in the space of a few years, were "wiped from the face of the earth."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The fires of the holocaust that consumed American Indians blazed in the fevers of newly encountered diseases, the flash of settlers&#x2019; and soldiers&#x2019; guns, the ravages of "firewater," and the scorched-earth policies of the white invaders. Russell Thornton describes how the holocaust had as its causes disease, warfare and genocide, removal and relocation, and destruction of aboriginal ways of life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Until recently most scholars seemed reluctant to speculate about North American Indian populations in 1492. In this book Thornton discusses in detail how many Indians there were, where they had come from, and how modern scholarship in many disciplines may enable us to make more accurate estimates of aboriginal populations.</p></p><p><p><strong>Russell Thornton</strong> is Professor of Sociology in the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>Just how many Indians were living in the Americas in 1492 is a hotly debated issue. In this well-organized presentation, Thornton systematically compares the various approaches scholars have taken , drawing his own conclusions . Among the factors he considers are the devastation caused by Old World diseases and wars with European settlers and the impact of Western removal on the Indian populace. Thornton also reviews contemporary Native American population gains and the increasing urbanization of this group as a whole in the 20th century.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, America's most prominent families came to the area to build the expansive summer retreats known as the Great Camps. Built and decorated with the region's natural resources, the camps reflected the serenity and indelible power of their surroundings--and the rustic Adirondack style was born.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>People are once again flocking to the area -- building new vacation retreats or restoring existing camps -- and creating fresh new perspectives on this classic American style. Author Ann Stillman O'Leary takes you through the rich and interesting history of the Adirondacks with an in-depth look at how its trademark building and decorating style is being interpreted today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The book's introduction, written by Elizabeth Folwell, the editor of Adirondack Life magazine, provides an overview of this distinctive area and the original owners and builders of the Great Camps. The remaining chapters explore the region's finest camps, both inside and out. More than 200 full-color and historical black-and-white photographs highlight all the elements unique to this style, from exterior stonework and twig filligree to interior fabrics and wall decor. A featured section shows how Adirondack furniture uses every bit of the tree, from root and burl to bark and branch, with amazing results. A thorough source guide identifies architects, builders, interior designers, manufacturers, craftspeople, and retail stores&nbsp;&nbsp;featuring camp merchandise, and a list of area lodging lets you experience the Adirondacks firsthand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Adirondack Style, the first book to take a comprehensive look at rustic design today,celebrates -- in words and images -- a style that is being referenced in homes from Maine to California.</p><p>The Adirondack "Great Camp" style bears witness to the long and interesting history of New York State's northeastern corner, from the splint basketry and bark sheathing used by the native people, the furs and skins so prized by the earliest white traders, the thick walls built by the French soldiers eager to protect their North American strongholds, and the unpeeled log structures of early lumberjacks. As well-heeled sportsmen of the late 19th century flocked to the area's lakes and mountains, they brought the touches--electric lights, Persian carpets, Craftsman-style fixtures--that made luxurious resorts of these large cabins. The word <i>camp</i> certainly doesn't imply <i>makeshift</i>; as Alfred Donaldson wrote in 1921, "It can only be said that 'camp' in Adirondack parlance has become a loose term applied indiscriminately to anything from a tent to a palace created in the woods, in more or less isolation, primarily for pleasure and summer recreation." <p> Ann Stillman O'Leary has developed what amounts to a primer on camp style, concentrating mainly on contemporary interpretations. As this style has come back into favor, it has incorporated more Scandinavian and Japanese elements that complement its rugged simplicity, and the interiors reflect the 20th-century insistence on better light and warmth. In short, the modern Adirondack camp style is at once cozy and elegant, and the faithful and appealing examples shown here will lead many readers in search of ways to create their own little "camps" at home.</p>ANN STILLMAN O'LEARY is an interior designer who has been a product manager for home furnishings in New York City and has designed accessories and greeting cards for Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Brentano's.

What a fresh kind of existence!</i><br>-Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, considering the possibility of writing an epic poem about the American explorer John Fremont</p><p>By the time Eustace Conway was seven years old, he could throw a knife accurately enough to nail a chipmunk to a tree. By the time he was ten, he could hit a running squirrel at fifty feet with a bow and arrow. When he turned twelve, he went out into the woods, alone and empty-handed, built himself a shelter, and survived off the land for a week. When he turned seventeen, he moved out of his family's home altogether and headed into the mountains, where he lived in a teepee of his own design, made fire by rubbing two sticks together, bathed in icy streams, and dressed in the skins of the animals he had hunted and eaten.</p><p>This move occurred in 1977, by the way. Which was the same year the film Star Wars was released.</p><p>The following year, when he was eighteen, Eustace Conway traveled the Mississippi River in a handmade wooden canoe, battling eddies so fierce, they could suck down a forty-foot tree and not release it to the surface again until a mile downriver. The next year, he set off on the two-thousand-mile Appalachian Trail, walking from Maine to Georgia and surviving almost exclusively on what he hunted and gathered along the way. And in the years that followed, Eustace hiked across the German Alps (in sneakers), kayaked across Alaska, scaled cliffs in New Zealand, and lived with the Navajo of New Mexico. When he was in his mid-twenties, he decided to study a primitive culture more closely in order to learn even more ancient skills. So he flew to Guatemala, got off the plane, and basically started asking, "Where are the primitive people at?" He was pointed toward the jungle, where he hiked for days and days until he found the remotest village of Mayan Indians, many of whom had never before seen a white person. He lived with the Maya for about five months, learning the language, studying the religion, perfecting his weaving skills. But his coolest adventure was probably in 1995, when Eustace got the notion to ride his horse across America. His younger brother, Judson, and a close family friend went with him. It was a mad act of whim. Eustace wasn't sure if it was possible or even legal to ride a horse across America. He just ate a big Christmas dinner with his family, strapped on his gun, hauled out an eighty-year-old U.S. Cavalry saddle (rubbed so thin in places that he could feel the heat of the animal between his legs as he rode), mounted his horse, and headed out. He reckoned that he and his partners could make it to the Pacific by Easter, although everyone he told this to laughed in his face.</p><p>The three riders galloped along, burning away nearly fifty miles a day. They ate roadkill deer and squirrel soup. They slept in barns and in the homes of awestruck locals, but when they reached the dry, open West, they fell off their horses every night and slept on the ground where they fell. They were nearly killed by swerving eighteen-wheelers when their horses went wild on a busy interstate bridge one afternoon. They were nearly arrested in Mississippi for not wearing shirts. In San Diego, they picketed their horses along a patch of grass between a mall and an eight-lane highway. They slept there that night and arrived at the Pacific Ocean the next afternoon. Eustace Conway rode his horse right into the surf. It was ten hours before Easter. He had crossed the country in 103 days, setting, while he was at it, a world record.</p><p>From coast to coast, Americans of every conceivable background had looked up at Eustace Conway on his horse and said wistfully, "I wish I could do what you're doing." And to every last citizen, Eustace had replied, "You can." But I'm getting ahead of my story here.</p><p>Eustace Conway was born in South Carolina in 1961. The Conways lived in a comfortable suburban home in a new neighborhood full of the same, but there was a fine patch of woods, standing right behind their house, that had not yet been cleared for development. It was, in fact, a wild, undisturbed, first-growth forest without so much as a trail cut through it. It was an old world forest, still filled with quicksand and bears. And it was here that Eustace Conway's father-whose name was also Eustace Conway and who knew everything-used to take his young son to teach him how to identify the plants, birds, and mammals of the American South. They would wander together in those woods for hours, looking up into the trees and discussing the shapes of the leaves. So these are Eustace Conway's first memories: the cosmic scope of the woods; the stipple of sunlight slanting through a verdant natural awning; the enlightening voice of the father; the loveliness of the words locust, birch, and tulip poplar; the new intellectual pleasure of study enhanced by the distinct physical sensation of his wobbly toddler's head tilting so far back that he might have toppled over from the effort of looking up so hard at so many trees for such a long time.</p><p>As for the rest, and over the years, it was his mother who taught Eustace. She taught him how to camp, bait a hook, build a fire, handle wildlife, weave grasses into rope, and find clay in river bottoms. She taught him how to read books with wonderful titles, like Davy Crockett: Young Adventurer and Wild Wood Wisdom. She taught him to sew buckskin. She taught him how to execute every task with ardent perfection. Eustace Conway's mother was not exactly like the other mothers of the day. She was a little gutsier than the average mom in the American South in the early 1960s. She'd been raised like a boy at a summer camp that her family had owned in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina. She was an unrepentant tomboy, a proficient horseback rider, and a capable woodsman who, at the age of twenty-two, had sold her silver flute for passage to Alaska, where she lived in a tent by a river with her gun and her dog.</p><p>By the time Eustace was five years old, the forest behind his house had been leveled by the real estate market, but the family soon moved to a four-bedroom home in another suburban development. It was in Gastonia, North Carolina, and had its own dense forest standing behind it. Mrs. Conway let Eustace and his young siblings have the run of the woods from the time they could walk-barefoot and shirtless and without supervision-from sunup to sundown, every moment of their childhood, except for those few interruptions for mandatory schooling and churchgoing (because it wasn't as though she were raising savages).</p><p>"I suppose I was a bad mother," Mrs. Conway says today, not very convincingly. The other mothers of Gastonia naturally were horrified by this childrearing technique, such as it was. Some of them, alarmed, would call Mrs. Conway on the telephone and say, "You can't let your babies play in those woods! There are poisonous snakes out there!" Thirty years later, Mrs. Conway still finds their concern amusing and adorable. "For heaven's sake!" she says. "My children always knew the difference between poisonous snakes and regular snakes! They did just fine out there."</p><p>Briefly, the history of America goes like this: there was a frontier, and then there was no longer a frontier. It all happened rather quickly. There were Indians, then explorers, then settlers, then towns, then cities. Nobody was really paying attention until the moment the wilderness was officially tamed, at which point everybody wanted it back. Within the general spasm of nostalgia that ensued (Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, Frederic Remington's cowboy paintings) there came a very specific cultural panic, rooted in the question What will become of our boys?</p><p>The problem was that, while the classic European coming-of-age story generally featured a provincial boy who moved to the city and was transformed into a refined gentleman, the American tradition had evolved into the opposite. The American boy came of age by leaving civilization and striking out toward the hills. There, he shed his cosmopolitan manners and became a robust and proficient man. Not a gentleman, mind you, but a man.</p><p>This was a particular kind of man, this wilderness-bred American. He was no intellectual. He had no interest in study or reflection. He had, as de Tocqueville noticed, "a sort of distaste for what is ancient." Instead, he could sterotypically be found, as the explorer John Fremont described the &#x178;ber-frontiersman Kit Carson, "mounted on a fine horse, without a saddle and scouring bare-headed over the prairies." Either that, or whipping his mighty ax over his shoulder and casually "throwing cedars and oaks to the ground," as one extremely impressed nineteenth-century foreign visitor observed. In fact, to all the foreign visitors during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the American Man was a virtual tourist attraction in his own right, almost as fascinating as Niagara Falls or that ambitious new railroad system or those exotic Indians. Not everybody was a fan, of course. ("There are perhaps no people, not even excepting the French, who are so vain as the Americans," griped one British observer in 1818. "Every American considers that it's impossible for a foreigner to teach him anything, and that his head contains a perfect encyclopedia.") Still, for better or worse, everyone seemed to agree that this was a new kind of human being and that what defined the American Man more than anything else was his resourcefulness, born out of the challenges of wrenching a New World from virgin wilderness. Unhindered by class restrictions, bureaucracy, or urban squalor, these Americans simply got more done in a single day than anyone had imagined possible. That was the bottom line: nobody could believe how fast these guys worked.</p><p>German-born Gottfried Duden, who traveled to the West in 1824 to identify suitable homesteads for German families interested in immigrating to America, reported home in wonder: "In North America, construction jobs which the European countries do not accomplish in centuries are completed in a few years, through the voluntary cooperation of individual citizens." At the time of Duden's visit, for instance, the farmers of Ohio were busy constructing a 230-mile-long canal without the help of a single licensed engineer. Duden saw "beautiful cities" thriving where not even towns had stood two years before. He saw new roads, new bridges, "thousands of new farms," and "a hundred more steamships"-all new, handmade, ingeniously designed, and perfectly operative. Did the American Man need something done? Well, then, he simply made it happen. It was such an attractive idea, this notion of the bold and competent New World citizen. The English travel writer Isabel Bird, famous for her cool and detached prose, seemed scarcely able to keep from exclaiming hubba-hubba as she checked out the rugged men she kept encountering on her trip to America in the 1850s:</p><p>"It is impossible to give an idea of the 'Western Men' to anyone who has not seen one at least as specimen . . . tall, handsome, broad-chested, and athletic, with aquiline noses, piercing grey eyes, and brown curling hair and beards. They wore leather jackets, leather smallclothes, large boots with embroidered tops, silver spurs, and caps of scarlet cloth, worked with somewhat tarnished gold thread, doubtless the gifts of some fair ones enamored of the handsome physiognomies and reckless bearing of the hunters. Dullness fled from their presence; they could tell stories, whistle melodies, and sing . . . Blithe, cheerful souls they were, telling racy stories of Western life, chivalrous in the manners and free as the winds."</p><p>Look, I wasn't there. It's hard to know how much of this rhetoric was based on truth and how much was the product of an excitable foreign press eager to testify on the Next Big Thing. What I do know is that we, the Americans, bought the hype. We bought it and added it to the already hearty stew of our homegrown self-mythology until we cooked up a perfectly universal notion of who the American Man was and how the American Man was made. He was Pecos Bill. He was Paul Bunyan. He altered the course of rivers with the help of his mighty blue ox, he broke wild horses using rattlesnakes as reins, and he was an omnipotent hero created through revelatory communion with the frontier. Everyone knew that.</p><p>So Frederick Jackson Turner wasn't the only person who got nervous when the news came in 1890 from the Census Department that the American frontier was suddenly and officially closed. But he was the first to ask what this closure would mean to future generations. His nervousness spread; the questions expanded. Without the wilderness as proving ground, what would become of our boys?</p><p>Why, they might become effete, pampered, decadent.</p><p>Lord help us, they might become Europeans.</p><p>I first met Eustace Conway in New York City, of all places. This was 1993.</p><p>I met Eustace through his brother Judson, who is a cowboy. Judson and I used to work together on a ranch out in the Wyoming Rockies. This was back when I was twenty-two years old, acting as if I were a Western cowgirl-an act that took considerable pretense, given the inconvenient reality that I was actually a former field hockey player from Connecticut. But I was out there in Wyoming because I was seeking an education and an authenticity that I thought could not be found anywhere but on the American frontier, or what remained of it.</p><p>I was searching for this American frontier as earnestly as my parents had sought it two decades earlier, when they'd purchased three acres of land in New England and pretended to be pioneers-raising chickens and goats and bees, growing all our food, sewing all our clothing, washing our hair in a rain barrel, and heating our house (and only two rooms of it) with hand-split firewood. My parents gave me and my sister as rugged a nineteenth-century upbringing as they could manage, even though we were living out the Reagan years in one of Connecticut's wealthiest communities and our insular little frontier farmhouse happened to be located on a major highway only a mile away from the country club.</p><p>Well, what of it? My sister and I were encouraged to ignore this reality. We picked blackberries in the ditches alongside that highway in our handmade dresses while the cars raced by and the passing eighteen-wheelers shook the ground. We went to school with goat's milk dried on our sleeves from the morning chores. We were taught to disregard the values of the culture that surrounded us and to concentrate instead on this sacred and more ancient American tenet: Resourcefulness Is Next to Godliness.</p><p>It is probably not surprising, then, that when I turned twenty-two I decided that I would not be satisfied by going on to graduate school or settling into some respectable career. I had other aspirations. I wanted to learn the boundaries of my own resourcefulness, and these, I believed, I could learn only in a place like Wyoming. I was inspired by the example of my parents and by Walt Whitman's stirring advice to American boys of the nineteenth century: "Ascend no longer from the textbook! Ascend to your own country! Go to the West and the South! Go among men, in the spirit of men! Master horses, become a good marksman and a stron...</p></p><h2>Cross Vision: How the Crucifixion of Jesus Makes Sense of Old Testament Violence</h2><p><p> The Old Testament God of wrath and violence versus the New Testament God of love and peace it's a difference that has troubled Christians since the first century. Now, with the sensitivity of a pastor and the intellect of a theologian, Gregory A. Boyd proposes the "cruciform hermeneutic," a way to read the Old Testament portraits of God through the lens of Jesus' crucifixion. </p> <p> In Cross Vision, Boyd follows up on his epic and groundbreaking study, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God. He shows how the death and resurrection of Jesus reframes the troubling violence of the Old Testament, how all of Scripture reveals God's self-sacrificial love, and, most importantly, how we can follow Jesus' example of peace. </p></p><p><p>Gregory A. Boyd is an internationally recognized theologian, preacher, teacher, apologist, and author. He is the cofounder and senior pastor of Woodland Hills Church in Maplewood, Minnesota, the founder and President of ReKnew Ministries, and the author and coauthor of twenty-one books, including <i>The Myth of a Christian Nation</i>.</p><p>"What if the harshest aspects of God in the Old Testament actually help us see the most beautiful aspects of Jesus on the cross? Sound like wishful thinking? Reading <em>Cross Vision</em> is like staring at a two-way mirror and suddenly being able to see what's happening on the other side. This book will show you how to read the Bible with fresh eyes and cause you to never see God the same way again! Easily one of the best and most transformative books I've ever read." --Jeremy Jernigan, lead pastor of Abundant Life Church, author of <em>Redeeming Pleasure</em></p> <p>"In <em>Cross Vision</em>, Gregory A. Boyd asks all the right questions about violence in the Old Testament, answering them in a unique and compelling way. The book is engaging, tightly written, and possesses theological integrity. My favorite part of the book is Boyd's discussion of cosmic principalities and powers active in the world today, a theme that gets far too little airplay in theological circles. This book is a must-read for all who have an interest in the topic of God and violence, as well as the hostile spiritual powers that operate in this present evil age."&#x2014;Frank Viola, author of <em>From Eternity to Here</em> and <em>Jesus Now</em></p> <p>"If you love the Bible but are torn by its violence, use this book as your therapy. Turn its pages and allow Boyd to unwind the majesty of the way God works. Afterwards, you'll find yourself more in awe of the God of Israel and even more confident that this God has inspired the Scriptures as his word. You'll agree with me that <em>Cross Vision</em> was a book well worth your time."&#x2014;David Fitch, Northern Seminary, author of <em>Faithful Presence</em></p> <p>"How shall we read the Old Testament with and through the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ? Gregory A. Boyd is a welcome, leading voice in today's urgent discourse and development of cruciform hermeneutics. This concise follow-up to <em>The Crucifixion of the Warrior God</em> makes Boyd's unique contribution to that conversation accessible to any thoughtful Bible reader. An important point of reference from here on."&#x2014;Brad Jersak, author of <em>A More Christlike God: A More Beautiful Gospel</em></p> <p>"Christians have long wrestled with understanding the violence attributed to God and God's people in the Old Testament, especially considering the contrasting picture of the loving, peacemaking Jesus seen in the New Testament. We reject Marcionism: we cannot accept that there are two different Gods in the two Testaments. Boyd has done Christianity a tremendous service by demonstrating respect for the scripture text, reverence for the character of God, and offering a way that we might understand the picture of a violent God."&#x2014;Dennis R. Edwards, senior pastor of Sanctuary Covenant Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, author of <em>1 Peter: The Story of God Bible Commentary</em></p> <p>"I don't judge you, I leave that to a wrathful, angry God to do, once retorted Ned Flanders to his wayward neighbor, Homer Simpson. <em>Cross Vision</em> gets right to the heart of a predicament that has befuddled generations. Jesus taught us to love our enemies, so how come God, as presented in all those Old Testament stories, didn't seem capable of keeping his own rules. An extraordinarily thought-provoking introduction to one of the biggest questions asked by those both inside and outside the church around the world today." &#x2014;Steve Chalke, founder and leader at Oasis Global and senior minister at Oasis Church Waterloo, London</p> <p>"For those struggling to reconcile the character of Jesus with the violent depictions of God in the Old Testament, Cross Vision is a priceless gift. Within these pages, Boyd uses vivid imagery and approachable storytelling to systematically unwrap a Calvary-centered, scripture-based explanation that will resonate with the heart while satisfying the mind. In short, this powerful work presents a beautiful picture of God that can revolutionize one's life and faith."&#x2014;Jessica Kelley, author of <em>Lord Willing?: Wrestling with God's Role in My Child&#x2019;s Death</em></p> <p>"Many thoughtful Christians are dissatisfied with the usual alternative approaches to the Bible and theology. They are told they can be either liberal or conservative, but both approaches carry baggage many find too heavy to bear. Gregory A. Boyd's greatest contribution to contemporary Christianity is to provide a completely different alternative neither liberal nor conservative but thoroughly Christ and cross-centered. <em>Cross Vision</em>, like so many of Boyd's other books, presents an alternative paradigm to the usual ones and does it with charm and challenge."&#x2014;Roger E.

The design and construction of this daring and deadly advance in weaponry took place at the German rocket development center at Peenem�nde, a remote island off the Baltic Coast. Now, Michael J. Neufeld gives the first comprehensive and accurate account of the story behind one of the greatest engineering feats of World War II. At a time when rockets were minor battlefield weapons, Germany ushered in a new form of warfare that would bequeath a long legacy of terror to the Cold War era and a tactical legacy that remains essential today. Both democracy's and communism's ballistic missile and space programs, as well as the SCUD and Patriot missiles of the Gulf War, began in the service of the Nazi State. </p></p><p><b>Michael J.

She travels between Amsterdam and New York City, where she lives with her family.Before I was the &#x201c;vile&#x201d; and &#x201c;chilly&#x201d; Odile, I was Michaela DePrince, and before I was Michaela, I was Mabinty Bangura, and this is the story of my flight from war orphan to ballerina.<br><br> In Africa my papa loved the dusty, dry winds of the Harmattan, which blew down from the Sahara Desert every December or January. &#x201c;Ah, the Harmattan has brought us good fortune again!&#x201d; he would exclaim when he returned from harvesting rice. I would smile when he said that because I knew that his next words would be &#x201c;But not as good a fortune as the year when it brought us Mabinty . . . no, never as good as that!&#x201d;<br><br> My parents said that I was born with a sharp cry and a personality as prickly as an African hedgehog. Even worse, I was a girl child--and a spotted one at that, because I was born with a skin condition called vitiligo, which caused me to look like a baby leopard. Nevertheless, my parents celebrated my arrival with joy.<br><br> When my father proclaimed that my birth was the high point of his life, his older brother, Abdullah, shook his head and declared, &#x201c;It is an unfortunate Harmattan that brings a girl child . . . a worthless, spotted girl child, one who will not even bring you a good bride-price.&#x201d; My mother told me that my father laughed at his brother. He and Uncle Abdullah did not see eye to eye on almost anything.<br><br> My uncle was right in one respect: in a typical household in the Kenema District of southeastern Sierra Leone, West Africa, my birth would not have been cause for celebration. But our household was not typical. First of all, my parents&#x2019; marriage had not been arranged. They had married for love, and my father refused to take a second wife, even after several years of marriage, when it appeared that I would be their only child. Secondly, both of my parents could read, and my father believed that his daughter should learn to read as well.<br><br> &#x201c;If my brother is right and no one will wish to marry a girl with skin like the leopard, it is important that our daughter go to school. Let&#x2019;s prepare her for that day,&#x201d; my father told my mother. So he began to teach me the abjad, the Arabic alphabet, when I was just a tiny pikin, barely able to toddle about.<br><br> &#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah sputtered when he saw Papa molding my little fingers around a stick of charcoal. &#x201c;Why are you teaching a girl child? She will think that she is above her station. All she needs to learn is how to cook, clean, sew, and care for children.&#x201d;<br> My spots scared the other children in our village. Nobody would play with me, except my cousins on occasion, so I would often sit alone on the stoop of our hut, thinking. I wondered why my father worked so hard panning for diamonds in the alluvial mines, diamonds that he would not be allowed to keep. It was hard, backbreaking work to stand bent over all day. Papa would hobble home at night, because his back, ankles, and feet ached. His hands would be swollen and painful from sifting the heavy, wet soil through his sieve. Then, one night while Mama was rubbing shea butter mixed with hot pepper into Papa&#x2019;s swollen joints, I overheard a conversation between them, and understood.<br><br> &#x201c;It is important that our daughter go to school to learn more than we are capable of teaching her. I want her to go to a good school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If we are frugal, the money from the mines will eventually be enough to pay her school fees, Alhaji,&#x201d; my mother said.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah, Jemi, count the money. How much have we saved so far?&#x201d; Papa asked.<br><br> Mama laughed. &#x201c;This much, plus the amount I counted the last time you asked,&#x201d; she said, holding up the coins he had brought home that evening.<br><br> I smiled a secret smile from my small space behind the curtain. I loved to listen to my parents&#x2019; voices at night. Though I cannot say the same for the voices of Uncle Abdullah and his wives.<br> Our house was set to the right of my uncle&#x2019;s house. Uncle Abdullah had three wives and fourteen children. Much to his unhappiness, thirteen of his children were girls, leaving my uncle and his precious son, Usman, the child of his first wife, as the only males in the household.<br><br> Many nights I would hear cries and shouts of anger drifting across the yard. The sounds of Uncle Abdullah beating his wives and daughters filled my family with sadness. I doubted that Uncle Abdullah ever loved any of his wives, or he would not have beaten them. He certainly didn&#x2019;t love his many daughters. He blamed any and all of his misfortunes on their existence.<br><br> My uncle cared only about his one son. He called Usman his treasure and fed him delicious tidbits of meat while his daughters looked on, hungry and bloated from a starchy diet of rice and cassava, that long, brown-skinned root vegetable that lacks vitamins and minerals. And nothing was more galling to my uncle than finding me outside, sitting cross-legged on a grass mat, studying and writing my letters, which I copied from the Qur&#x2019;an. He could not resist poking me with the toe of his sandal and ordering me to get about the duties of a woman.<br><br> &#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah would sputter at my papa. &#x201c;Put this child to work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What need does she have of womanly chores? She is only a child herself,&#x201d; Papa would remind his brother, and then couldn&#x2019;t resist adding: &#x201c;Yes, not even four years old, and yet she speaks Mende, Temne, Limba, Krio, and Arabic. She picks up languages from the marketplace and learns quickly. She will surely become a scholar.&#x201d; Papa didn&#x2019;t need to rub any more salt in Uncle Abdullah&#x2019;s wounds by reminding him that Usman, who was several years older than me, lagged far behind me in his studies.<br><br> &#x201c;What she needs is a good beating,&#x201d; Uncle Abdullah would counter. &#x201c;And that wife of yours, she too needs an occasional beating. You are spoiling your women, Alhaji. No good will ever come of that.&#x201d;<br><br> Perhaps Papa should not have bragged about my learning. The villagers and my uncle thought that I was strange enough with my spots, and my reading made me even stranger in their eyes and made my uncle hate me.<br><br> The only thing that my father and his brother had in common was the land that fed us, sheltered us, and provided the rice, palm wine, and shea butter that we sold at the market.<br><br> At night, when I heard the cries coming from across the yard, I&#x2019;d turn my ear toward my parents resting on the other side of the curtain. From there I heard sweet words of love and soft laughter. Then I would thank Allah because I had been born into the house on the right, rather than the one on the left.</p><h2>The Large Catechism of Martin Luther</h2><p>By 1529, the year of publication of Luther&#39;s Large Catechism, parishioners took the Gospel for granted. Many had forgotten at what great peril the freedom of their faith had been won. In the Large Catechism Luther set out to inculcate the centrality of the Gospel that was largely neglected and whose freedom was frequently abused. Whether Luther is therefore dealing with the Ten Commandments or the Lord&#39;s Supper, the dynamic of the Word of God as Gospel provides the cutting edge for what he says. To obscure the Gospel is to lose everything; to illuminate it is to gain all it promises. But it is not a Gospel with a purely individualistic thrust. To risk all for the Gospel is to relate one&#39;s self to society and the Christian community. And it is this corporate dimension of the Gospel, involving him who believes all to serve all, which gives Luther&#39;s exposition of the basic ingredients of the Christian faith such significance and relevance. Therefore the Large Catechism is a primary source for an understanding of the Christian ethos in action in Reformation Christianity. The Gospel is particularized. The social situation comes alive in concrete terms in a language whose meaning is unmistakable and clear.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b> <br><br>"Martin Luther (November 10, 1483 February 18, 1546) was a German monk, theologian, and church reformer. He is also considered to be the founder of Protestantism.<br><br>Luther's theology challenged the authority of the papacy by holding that the Bible is the sole source of religious authority and that all baptized Christians are a general priesthood. According to Luther, salvation was attainable only by faith in Jesus as the Messiah, a faith unmediated by the church. These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization.<br><br>Luther's translation of the Bible into the German vernacular, making it more accessible to ordinary people, had a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. The translation also furthered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation of the English King James Bible. His hymns inspired the development of congregational singing within Christianity. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.<br>Luther is also known for his writings about the Jews, the nature and consequences of which are the subject of scholarly debate. His statements that Jews' homes should be destroyed, their synagogues burned, money confiscated, and liberty curtailed, were revived and given widespread publicity by the Nazis in Germany in 1933 45. As a result of this and his revolutionary theological views, his legacy remains controversial." <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i></p><h2>Hyperion (SF Masterworks)</h2><p>2011 edition Gollancz SF Masterworks paperback new condition.

Who listened to this "good news," and who ignored it? Where did Christianity spread, and how? Based on <em>quantitative</em> data and the latest scholarship, preeminent scholar and journalist Rodney Stark presents new and startling information about the rise of the early church, overturning many prevailing views of how Christianity grew through time to become the largest religion in the world.</p><p>Drawing on both archaeological and historical evidence, Stark is able to provide hard statistical evidence on the religious life of the Roman Empire to discover the following facts that set conventional history on its head:</p><ul><p></p><li>Contrary to fictions such as <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> and the claims of some prominent scholars, Gnosticism was not a more sophisticated, more authentic form of Christianity, but really an unsuccessful effort to paganize Christianity.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Paul was called the apostle to the Gentiles, but mostly he converted Jews.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Paganism was not rapidly stamped out by state repression following the vision and conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine in 312 AD, but gradually disappeared as people abandoned the temples in response to the superior appeal of Christianity.</li><p></p><p></p><li>The "oriental" faiths&#x2014;such as those devoted to Isis, the Egyptian goddess of love and magic, and to Cybele, the fertility goddess of Asia Minor&#x2014;actually prepared the way for the rapid spread of Christianity across the Roman Empire.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Contrary to generations of historians, the Roman mystery cult of Mithraism posed no challenge to Christianity to become the new faith of the empire&#x2014; it allowed no female members and attracted only soldiers.</li><p></p></ul><p>By analyzing concrete data, Stark is able to challenge the conventional wisdom about early Christianity offering the clearest picture ever of how this religion grew from its humble beginnings into the faith of more than one-third of the earth's population.</p></p><p><p>Rodney Stark is the Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences at Baylor University. His thirty books on the history and sociology of religion include <em>The Rise of Christianity</em>, <em>Cities of God</em>, <em>For the Glory of God</em>, <em>Discovering God</em>, and <em>The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success</em>. Stark received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>Contemplating the rapid spread of early Christianity, Lucian the Martyr marveled in the fourth century that "almost the greater part of the world is now committed to this truth, even whole cities." To explain Christianity's remarkable success in capturing the cities of the Roman Empire, Stark deploys an empirical social science that exposes the flaws in previous historical theorizing. By parsing records of church construction, inscriptions on tombs, and names on imperial contract permits, Stark converts plausible conjectures into testable hypotheses about the growth of Christianity in the 31 largest Roman cities. And while some of the statistically validated hypotheses fit within conventional wisdom, others compel fresh thinking. The traditional belief that Christianity spread through mass conversion, for instance, gives way to a numerically substantiated dynamics of person-to-person conversion. And despite recent acclaim for the Gnostics as the true early Christians, the evidence links the Gnostic impulse to dying pockets of stubborn paganism, not the rising new faith. Like Stark's <i>Victory of Reason</i> (2005), this book will spark controversy--the kind that attracts curious readers. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From his initial period in Leiden to his early and late phases in Amsterdam, the stages of Rembrandt&#x2019;s career mirror the artistic and intellectual developments of the century.<br> <br> After breaking off his studies in Leiden, the young Rembrandt trained as a painter for two years and eventually established his own painting workshop. Characteristic of the Leiden period are his biblical histories, such as <em>The Raising of Lazarus</em>, but the roots of Rembrandt&#x2019;s portraiture, nourished by his intensive studies of physiognomy, also are to be found in these same years. Later, in Amsterdam, the perfection of Rembrandt&#x2019;s likenesses initially won him the favor of numerous patrons&#x2014;but the artist soon surpassed their expectations. Transcending traditional modes of presentation, Rembrandt composed his portraits in the same manner in which he had earlier constructed his scenes. The results are visible, for example, in the famous group portrait <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</em> from 1632. In the last phase of Rembrandt&#x2019;s work&#x2014;when, plagued by financial problems, he had withdrawn into seclusion&#x2014;it is no longer possible to distinguish between event paintings and portraits. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Michael Bockem�hl (b. 1943) studied art history, philosophy and ecclesiastical history in Munich and Bochum.

This happy book reveals the challenges, cares and joys of that cloistered life from an &#34;insiders&#34; view. The poet&#39;s cry, &#34;O world, I cannot hold you close enough!&#34; is the heart&#39;s cry of the enclosed contemplative. No one who has not lived in a cloister can fully understand just how intertwined are the lives of cloistered nuns. Their hearts may be wide as the universe and bottomless as eternity, but the practical details of their living are boxed up into the small area within the enclosure walls. Cloistered nuns rub souls as well as elbows all their lives, and if they do not step out of themselves to get a true perspective, they can become small-souled and petty and remain immature children all their lives long. But, as Mother Mary Francis points out, they also have &#34;as great a right to be merry as any lady in the world.&#34; Nor is merriment all. &#34;Hidden away from the glare and noise of worldly living,&#34; Mother Mary Francis writes, &#34;we are enclosed in the womb of holy Church. I walk down the cloisters, and my heart moves to a single tune: Lord, it is good, so good to be here!&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Provence A-Z</h2><p>An indispensable, richly informative, and always entertaining sourcebook on Provence by the writer who has made the region his own. <br><br> Though organized from A to Z, this is hardly a conventional work of reference. It is rather a selection of those aspects of Provence that Peter Mayle in almost twenty years there has found to be the most interesting, curious, delicious, or down-right fun. <br><br> In more than 170 entries he writes about subjects as wide-ranging as architecture and <i>zingue-zingue-zoun </i>(in the local patois, a word meant to describe the sound of a violin), as diverse as expatriates, Aix-en-Provence, the Proven�al character, legends, lavender, linguistic oddities, the museum of the French Foreign Legion, the museum of the corkscrew, the origins of &#x201c;La Marseillaise,&#x201d; and a bawdy folklore character named Fanny.<br><br> And, of course, he writes about food and drink: <i>vin ros�,</i> truffles, olives, melons, <i>bouillabaisse,</i> the cheese that killed a Roman emperor, even a cure for indigestion. The wonderful accompanying artwork includes curiosities Mayle has gathered over the years<i>&#x2014;</i>matchbooks, drawings, century-old ads, photos, tourist brochures, maps.<br> <i>Provence A-Z </i>is a delight for Peter Mayle&#x2019;s ever-growing audience and the perfect complement to any guidebook on Provence, or, for that matter, France.</p><p>Peter Mayle is the author of eleven books on Provence. Recently he was awarded the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur by the French government. He lives with his wife in Provence.<b>Tapenade</b><br><br><i>It has been called the black butter of Provence (although it may frequently be green), and it is one of those happy gastronomic inventions that sharpen both appetite and thirst. Normally, therefore, you will find it served with your ap�ritif before you get down to the serious business of making your way through the menu. </i><br><br><i>The name comes from the Proven�al word tapeno, or caper, and capers are an essential part of every tapenade recipe. Other ingredients can vary slightly according to taste, but I recommend following the instructions of Monsieur Meynier, the Marseille chef who invented tapenade more than a century ago. Here's his original recipe: <br></i><br><br> 200 grams black olives, pits removed<br>100 grams unsalted anchovy filets<br>100 grams tuna in oil<br>large spoonful strong mustard<br>pinch of <i>fines herbes</i><br>200 milliliters olive oil<br>a glass of Cognac<br>Take 200 grams of black olives, with their pits removed. Crush the olives, using mortar and pestle, together with 200 grams of capers, 100 grams of unsalted anchovy fillets, 100 grams oftuna in oil, a large spoonful of strong mustard, <i>"pas mal de poivre,"</i> and a pinch of <i>fines herbes</i>.<br><br>As you crush, add, little by little, 200 milliliters of olive oil.<br><br>The final touch: mix in a glass of Cognac.<br><i>The resulting thick and wonderfully pungent black paste, gleaming with oil, is traditionally spread on small pieces of toast. But it would be a shame to restrict tapenade to toast. Try it with hard-boiled quail's eggs, with tomatoes, with fresh goat cheese, with plain grilled fish, or a cold vegetable omelette. I have also seen it used as a dip for potato chips and eaten, on its own, by the spoonful. It is that good. </i><br><b><br></b><br><br><b>Accent</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>There is a popular misconception that the language spoken in Provence is French. It resembles French, certainly; indeed, in written form it is almost identical. But remove it from the page and apply it to the ear, and Proven�al French might easily be another language. If words were edible, Proven�al speech would be a rich, thick, pungent verbal stew, simmered in an accent filled with twanging consonants; a <i>civet</i>, perhaps, or maybe a<i> daube</i>.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Before coming to live in Provence, I acquired a set of Berlitz tapes in order to improve my grasp of French, which I hadn&#x2019;t studied since my schooldays. Evening after evening, I would sit and listen to cassettes of the most mellifluous, perfectly enunciated phrases&#x2014;spoken, I believe, by a lady from Tours. (I was told that the accent of Tours is considered a jewel among accents, the most polished and refined in France.)<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Every morning in front of the mirror while shaving, I would do my best to imitate this accent, pursing my Anglo-Saxon lips until they could pronounce something close to the Gallic u, practicing the growl from the back of the throat that is so necessary for the rolling Gallic r. Little by little, I thought, I was making progress. And then I left England to come south.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>It was an instant farewell to the lady from Tours, because the sound of the words I encountered in Provence was unlike anything I had heard before. And to make matters even more incomprehensible, these words were delivered with an incredible velocity, a vocabulary gone berserk. My ears were in shock for months, and for at least a year I was unable to conduct any kind of sustained conversation without a dictionary. This I used much as a blind man uses a white stick: to identify obstacles and try to find my way around them.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>To this day, many years later, there are times when words, even sentences, pass me by in a glutinous blur of sound. Living as I do in the country, I have noticed that the rural accent is perhaps a little thicker&#x2014;or, some might say, purer&#x2014;than in bastions of urban civilization like Aix or Avignon. But then there is Marseille, a special case. Here the unsuspecting visitor will have to contend not only with the accent but with an entire sub-language. How, I wonder, would the lady from Tours react if she were offered a <i>pastaga</i>, directed to the nearest <i>pissadou</i>, cautioned against employing a <i>massacan</i>, accused of being <i>raspi</i>, invited to a <i>baletti</i>, or admired for her <i>croille</i>? Like me, I suspect, she would find it all extremely puzzling, even <i>comac</i>.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br> Translations:<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br> <i> pastaga</i> = pastis<br><i>pissadou</i> = toilet<br><i>massacan</i> = a bad worker<br><i>raspi </i>= miserly<br><i>baletti</i> = a small dance; what used to be known as a bal populaire<br><i>croille</i> = arrogance, effrontery, chutzpah<br><i>comac</i> = extraordinary<br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Ail</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>It has been said that Provence is a region that has been rubbed with garlic. Whether you think of garlic as <i>le divin bulbe</i> or the stinking rose or the poor man&#x2019;s panacea, there&#x2019;s no getting away from it&#x2014;in soups, in sauces, in salads, with fish, with meat, with pasta, with vegetables, on or in bread. And if there isn&#x2019;t quite enough of it for your taste, you can always resort to this old Proven�al habit: Take a clove of garlic (probably the one you always carry in your pocket for just such a gastronomic emergency), peel it, and hold it between the thumb and index finger of your right hand. With your left hand, hold a fork with its tines facing downward on a plate. Grate the garlic briskly across the tines until you have enough aromatic juice and fragments on your plate to season the food to your liking.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>When considering garlic&#x2019;s history and reputation, it is often difficult to sort out fact from legend. We are told that the laborers building the pyramids of ancient Egypt went on strike because their garlic ration was late in being distributed. This is confirmed by several sources and is probably true. On the other hand, you have the vampire-repellent theories&#x2014;carry a head of garlic with you at all times, and rub garlic on window frames, door handles, and the floor around your bed for nocturnal protection&#x2014;which probably aren&#x2019;t. Other slightly dubious claims include garlic&#x2019;s supposed ability to neutralize snake and insect venom; to cure leprosy, asthma, and whooping cough; and to protect against cholera and the evil eye <i>(&#x201c;Bon ail contre mauvais oeil&#x201d;)</i>.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But nothing in the medical history of garlic, at least in Provence, is quite as impressive as the tale of the four thieves. It takes place in Marseille in 1726, when hundreds of inhabitants were dropping like flies from the plague. Our four thieves (today their nearest equivalent would be ambulance-chasing lawyers) visited the empty houses of the recently dead and ransacked them. Growing careless, the thieves were eventually caught and brought to trial. Fortunately for them, the judge had an inquiring mind. How was it, he asked them, that you were able to enter all those contaminated houses without being stricken yourselves by the plague?<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Plea-bargaining ensued. In exchange for leniency, the thieves revealed their secret, a powerful elixir that made them immune from the plague. It must have seemed at the time as miraculous as the discovery of penicillin, and from that day on it was called<i> le vinaigre des quatres voleurs</i>, or four thieves&#x2019; vinegar. The ingredients are vinegar, absinthe, rosemary, sage, mint&#x2014;and, naturally, garlic. (Absinthe is difficult to find nowadays, but pastis would probably be an acceptable substitute.) Not surprisingly, the Marseillais quickly found themselves among the most enthusiastic consumers of garlic in France. They still are.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>There is no doubt about some other, less dramatic health-giving properties. Garlic is an antiseptic, a disinfectant, and an inhibitor of bacteria. It is rich in vitamins B1 and C. Medical studies suggest that garlic eaters show a lower incidence of stomach cancer, may be less prone than average to strokes and cardiovascular disease, and possess blood of exceptional purity.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Alas, the same cannot be said for their breath. Garlic-induced halitosis has been something of a social obstacle ever since man popped that first clove in his mouth thousands of years ago. King Henri IV of France used to eat a clove every morning. It was said by one of his contemporaries that his breath could knock over a steer at twenty paces. And yet he was also a renowned ladies&#x2019; man, which leads me to believe that his lady friends had discovered the only truly effective solution to the problem of garlic breath in others. Which is, of course, to eat garlic&#x2014;and plenty of it&#x2014;yourself.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Aioli</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The Proven�al poet Fr�d�ric Mistral, a man with a lyrical turn of phrase and a practical turn of mind, praised <i>aioli </i>for possessing, among its many other virtues, the ability to keep away flies. I have also known it occasionally to repel humans, particularly those delicate souls accustomed to a cuisine that is largely innocent of garlic.<i> Aioli</i> is not for those with timid taste buds.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Technically, it is mayonnaise. But it is mayonnaise with guts, and to compare it to conventional mayonnaise is like comparing a slice of processed cheese to a ripe Camembert. This classic recipe explains why:<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>For eight people, you will need sixteen cloves of garlic, the yolks of three eggs, and ne...</p><h2>Gun Digest 2019, 73rd Edition: The World&#39;s Greatest Gun Book!</h2><p><b>For more than 70 years, <i>Gun Digest</i></b> has been the No. 1 go-to source and research guide for firearms enthusiasts worldwide.

Other people collect coins. Carol Otis Hurst's father collected rocks. Nobody ever thought his obsession would amount to anything. They said, "You've got rocks in your head" and "There's no money in rocks." But year after year he kept on collecting, trading, displaying, and labeling his rocks. The Depression forced the family to sell their gas station and their house, but his interest in rocks never wavered. And in the end the science museum he had visited so often realized that a person with rocks in his head was just what was needed.</p><p>Anyone who has ever felt a little out of step with the world will identify with this true story of a man who followed his heart and his passion.</p></p><p><p>Carol Otis Hurst is a storyteller, teacher, children's book critic, and columnist for <em>Teaching K-8 Magazine</em>. She is the author of the <em>Boston Globe-Horn Book</em> Honor Book <em>Rocks in His Head</em>. </p>With great affection and an appealing nostalgia, Hurst (Through the Lock, reviewed below) recounts the story of her father, an avid rock collector from the time he was a boy. When people commented that "he had rocks in his pockets and rocks in his head," he would answer with an agreeable "Maybe I have," then reach into his pocket and eagerly add, "Take a look at this one." This response, conveying both the hero's humility and passion, becomes a recurring refrain. Stevenson conveys the fellow's easygoing manner with elegant pen-and-ink wash illustrations. Together, author and artist chart the boy's growth into manhood and touch on the world events that shape him. As a young man, he opens a filling station, where he displays his labeled rocks and minerals and learns how to repair the then-new Model T. After the Depression shuts down his business, he moves his cherished collection into the attic of his home, finding odd jobs wherever he can. The story's conclusion will prove as satisfying to readers as it was to Hurst's father: the director of the local museum offers him a dream job the position of curator of mineralogy. Dominated by earth tones, Stevenson's artwork convincingly evokes both the personality of this endearing protagonist and the period in which he lived. An emphatic endorsement for youngsters to follow their passions.

A once-thriving border town, it now resembles a failed state. Infamously known as the place where women disappear, its murder rate exceeds that of Baghdad. Last year 1,607 people were killed&#x2014;a number that is on pace to increase in 2009.<p>In <i>Murder City</i>, Charles Bowden&#x2014;one of the few journalists who has spent extended periods of time in Ju�rez&#x2014;has written an extraordinary account of what happens when a city disintegrates. Interweaving stories of its inhabitants&#x2014;a raped beauty queen, a repentant hitman, a journalist fleeing for his life&#x2014;with a broader meditation on the town's descent into anarchy, Bowden reveals how Ju�rez's culture of violence will not only worsen, but inevitably spread north.</p><p>Heartbreaking, disturbing, and unforgettable, <i>Murder City</i> establishes Bowden as one of our leading writers working at the height of his powers.</p></p><p><b>Charles Bowden</b>, the recipient of a Lannan Literary Award and the Sidney Hillman Award, is the critically acclaimed author of numerous books, including <i>Down by the River</i> and <i>Some of the Dead Are Still Breathing</i>. He is a contributing editor for <i>GQ</i> and <i>Mother Jones</i>, and also writes for <i>Harper-s</i>, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and <i>Aperture</i>. He lives in Tucson, Arizona.Just across the Rio Grande from El Paso sits Ju�rez, Mexico, a city so overtaken with the violence of drug trafficking that its leading citizens&#x2014;police, politicians, even the drug lords&#x2014;find it safer to live in El Paso. Bowden, critically acclaimed author of Some of the Dead Are Still Breathing (2009), details the forces that have led to Mexico&#x2019;s place in the multinational drug business. Hundreds of millions of dollars flow into Ju�rez each week, and the violence and corruption that follow yield 200 to 300 murders each year. Bowden laments the silence on both sides of the border that permits the slaughter that goes mostly unnoted and unreported. Behind the numbers, he details the lives lost or destroyed: a reporter fleeing for his life with his young son, a beautiful woman gang-raped, a killer for the cartels who is now being hunted. He chronicles a town that has been the site of numerous mass graves of victims and of monuments to fallen police that bear hit lists from the cartels.

On June 14, 1968, Suhaili, a tiny ketch, slipped almost unnoticed out of Falmouth harbor while Knox-Johnston&#39;s family and a few friends waved goodbye to the solitary twenty-nine-year-old figure at the helm. His was an incredible adventure, a feat of endeavor and seamanship which will be unsurpassed and unforgotten. Sheer determination helped him survive every imaginable difficulty: Several knockdowns in the Southern Ocean, the disintegration of the self-steering system, polluted water tanks and acid burns were among the numerous setbacks he encountered even before reaching Cape Horn, the fearsome test of any seaman&#39;s nerve.</p><p></p><h2>The Old-Fashioned Cookbook</h2><p>&#34;Over 700 easy-to-prepare and tempting recipes collected from all 50 states--representing 200 years of American cooking.

Fisher&#39;s Translation of Brillat-Savarin&#39;s The Physiology of Taste: Or Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy</h2><p>The Physiology of Taste or Transcendental Gastronomy by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin Translated from the last Paris edition by Fayette Robinson. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin; 1 April 1755, Belley, Ain &#x2013; 2 February 1826, Paris, was a French lawyer and politician, and gained fame as an epicure and gastronome: "Grimod and Brillat-Savarin. Between them, two writers effectively founded the whole genre of the gastronomic essay." His famous work, Physiologie du go�t (The Physiology of Taste), was published in December 1825, two months before his death. The full title is Physiologie du Go�t, ou M�ditations de Gastronomie Transcendante; ouvrage th�orique, historique et � l'ordre du jour, d�di� aux Gastronomes parisiens, par un Professeur, membre de plusieurs soci�t�s litt�raires et savantes. The book has not been out of print since it first appeared, shortly before Brillat-Savarin's death. Its most notable English translation was done by food writer and critic M. F. K. Fisher, who remarked "I hold myself blessed among translators." Her translation was first published in 1949. The body of his work, though often wordy or excessively - and sometimes dubiously - aphoristic and axiomatic, has remained extremely important and has repeatedly been re-analyzed through the years since his death. In a series of meditations that owe something to Montaigne's Essays, and have the discursive rhythm of an age of leisured reading and a confident pursuit of educated pleasures, Brillat-Savarin discourses on the pleasures of the table, which he considers a science. His French models were the stylists of the Ancien R�gime: Voltaire, Rousseau, F�nelon, Buffon, Cochin and d'Aguesseau.</p><p>You can't properly call yourself a gourmand (or even a minor foodie) until you've digested Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's delectable 1825 treatise, <i>The Physiology of Taste: Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy</i>. Brilliantly and lovingly translated in 1949 by M.F.K. Fisher (herself the doyenne of 20th-century food writing), the book offers the Professor's meditations not just on matters of cooking and eating, but extends to sleep, dreams, exhaustion, and even death (which he defines as the "complete interruption of sensual relations"). Brillat-Savarin, whose genius is in the examination and discussion of food, cooking, and eating, proclaims that "the discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star."<p> Chocoholics will be satisfied to know that "carefully prepared chocolate is as healthful a food as it is pleasant ... that it is above all helpful to people who must do a great deal of mental work...." He examines the erotic properties of the truffle ("the truffle is not a positive aphrodisiac; but it can, in certain situations, make women tenderer and men more agreeable"), the financial influence of the turkey (apparently quite a prize in 19th-century Paris), and the level of <i>gourmandise</i> among the various professions (bankers, doctors, writers, and men of faith are all predestined to love food). Just as engrossing as the text itself are M.F.K. Fisher's lively, personal glosses at the end of every chapter, which make up almost a quarter of the book. These two are soulmates separated by centuries, and Fisher's fondness for the Professor comes through on every page. As she notes at the end, "I have yet to be bored or offended, which is more than most women can say of any relationship, either ghostly or corporeal." <i>--Rebecca A.

His first memoir, <i>Losing My Virginity</i>, and his numerous books on business have been international bestsellers.Chapter 1<br><br> 1999<br><br> Necker Island, New Year's Eve, 1998. I was in my bedroom, trying to make an urgent to-do list. As I stared at the blank piece of paper in front of me, across a sandy path, a song Prince released in 1982 was booming around the Great House on repeat. It was a song that let everyone know 1998 was nearly over and the ball was about to drop on the last year of the millennium: 1999.<br><br> The New Year's festivities were in full swing. My daughter, Holly was, leading the celebrations with our family and friends. I could hear the clink of glasses as my wife, Joan, toasted with friend while our fourteen-year-old son, Sam, ran around getting under her feet. They were the familiar sounds of family life and ones that I was grateful to hear after my adventures of the previous weeks.<br><br> Five days earlier, on Boxing Day, I had arrived on the island fresh from my last ballooning adventure. I was lucky to be alive. On 18 December, Steve Fossett and I had set off from Marrakech in the hope of completing a record-breaking round-the-world trip. What had followed was a mixture of high-stakes adventure and diplomacy-pulling in favors as our balloon had veered over Libyan airspace, then having our approval to fly over China rescinded before being reinstated as we made our way over Nepal. Finally, having got close to crossing the Pacific, the winds blew us back, forcing us to land in the ocean near Hawaii. I'd made it there for Christmas, then flew on to Necker Island the following day.<br><br> Back in the security of home, with the end of the year approaching and the end of the millennium looming, I found myself both reflecting back and looking forward. As so often during my life as an entrepreneur, I really had no idea what was coming next. I had created and sold the biggest independent record label on the planet, and fought doggedly to build Virgin Atlantic into the best airline in the world. The Virgin Group had grown from a couple of companies to more than a hundred and I had gone from a struggling hippy to a proud father and businessman. My mind was starting to wander to other projects, fresh ambitions and bigger dreams. Within the space of twelve months we would launch nine different companies and begin turning Virgin into the all-encompassing global brand it is today. It was time for a new start, and to look to the stars.<br><br> --------<br><br> How do you go about becoming a millionaire? I'm often asked this question and ever since I founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984 my answer has been the same: "Start as a billionaire and launch a new airline."<br><br> The first fifteen years of Virgin Atlantic had been a topsy-turvy tale of excitement, innovation and survival. We had taken the might of British Airways head on and, unlike the airlines that came before us, lived to tell the tale. In fact, we won one of the largest libel cases in British history after BA's Dirty Tricks campaign tried to put us out of business. It was a campaign that most people within the industry knew by another name altogether: Operation Barbara. Why was it called that? Because Barbara Cartland had written a lot of novels about virgins getting screwed.<br><br> As we emerged from this most challenging of periods, I had clear skies for the first time in a while, exploring new horizons for the Virgin brand. Many experts will tell you it tends to take a year to get a business off the ground, from the initial idea through planning, market research, development and launch. Personally, I've always disregarded this rule. As far as I'm concerned, anyone following it should pull their finger out.<br><br> When I was a wide-eyed teenager, our mail-order record company was set up in a couple of days, and even more complex businesses like Virgin Atlantic went from idea to lift-off in a matter of weeks. Generally, we like to work fast: try ideas, see if they stick, and, if they don't, quickly move on to the next one.<br><br> I work best when my mind is able to jump from one topic to the next in quick succession. It keeps things lively, and it's amazing how often good ideas for one company come out of another completely unrelated business. As I took a step back from the day-to-day running of Virgin Atlantic, I was able to concentrate on what was next for Virgin. As it turns out, there was more than even I had ever imagined.<br><br> The turn of the century was to prove unprecedentedly productive, even by our standards. After my first wave as a records impresario and second as an airline founder, the third wave of my career as a global entrepreneur was about to begin in earnest. Some of the companies, namely Virgin Blue (now Australia), virginmoney.com, Virgin Wines and Virgin Mobile Australia have gone on to become big success stories. We had already launched the likes of Virgin Clothing, Virgin Brides, Virgin Cola, Virgin Vodka and Virgin Vie cosmetics by this point, all of which would disappear in the next few years. But failures didn't put me off at all. They had all been fun to get stuck into, and we'd learned a lot of important lessons.<br><br> Some businesses quickly turned into far less successful operations. Virgin Cars, our automobile company, was effective for a few years but overnight became unworkable. Our business model of purchasing cars, mostly from the Netherlands and Belgium, and importing them to sell into the UK was destroyed by a combination of restrictive practices by the big carmakers and changing currency values. V.Shop, small record stores we launched after rebranding Our Price, never got off the ground, while there were similar stories for Virgin Student, Virgin Energy and Virgin Travelstore. The dot.com bubble was still going strong, but we hadn't quite got the hang of it. Because our core businesses remained solid, the brand wasn't derailed by these smaller failures. I was also able to spend even more time with my young family and enjoy life a little more. I didn't feel I had so much to prove, and was getting more comfortable in my own skin. If the odd business didn't work out, I was confident there would be another on the way.<br><br> We were beginning to see which core areas we could expand the brand into, but it was still taking time for me to understand how flexible the Virgin brand was, the areas where it could bend successfully, and the areas where it would break. The sweet spot was always where we could differentiate from the competition, in service and in product, and where there was a real appetite for change. We were still a long way from creating the more structured strategy we have today, but it was one hell of a ride finding out what worked.<br><br> With the financial clout we had gained from selling Virgin Records and the profile lift our battles against BA had inadvertently given us, Virgin Atlantic continued to grow in popularity and profit. I was determined for us to capitalize. Our fleet grew to twenty-eight jets, and by the end of 1999 we had agreed a deal to sell 49 percent of the company to Singapore Airlines for �600 million in cash. This would give more opportunity to invest in new businesses and reinvest in Virgin Atlantic's customer experience, while maintaining a controlling stake in our airline. We had already become the first airline in the world to introduce seatback video across our fleet. Now we became the worldwide launch customer for the new Airbus A340-600 and introduced new successful routes everywhere from Las Vegas to St. Lucia, Delhi to Barbados and Shanghai to Cape Town.<br><br> I began to enjoy flying Virgin Atlantic even more when we created the first ever double beds in the air in business class, and could even continue my meetings mid-flight when we launched Earth Calling in-seat call service via passengers' mobile phones. Now there really was no escape for my team from phone calls at all hours! Thankfully for them, we also introduced the first ever in-flight bars. It's amazing who you can get talking to and what you can get discussing over a few drinks at 30,000 feet. I've heard hundreds of business pitches at our sky-high bars over the years and several have gone on to become successful companies. As for matchmaking, there are few things I love more than setting up a couple while they sip a drink above the clouds. And at least one hit single has been written at the bar, while birds go flying at the speed of sound outside the window . . .<br><br> One morning in September 1999 I was woken up at four in the morning to learn that BA was having a little trouble with a big wheel. BA was paying big money to be the sponsor of the new London Eye, but its launch was fraught with technical problems. When they were finally ready to launch it, ahead of celebrating the millennium, they were unable to erect the wheel. We just so happened to own an airship company nearby in the Home Counties, so I got on the phone to the team.<br><br> "We need to scramble a blimp," I told them. "How quickly can you get one to the Thames?"<br><br> With the world's press assembled and the wheel lying limply on the South Bank lawn, our blimp hovered directly above, proudly displaying the legend "BA CAN'T GET IT UP." We got the headlines that night at BA's expense-literally! The photo also coincided with the same day BA's share price plunged to a new record low.<br><br> The following year, I pulled BA's tail again when we revamped our free in-flight massages for Upper Class customers. Right outside Heathrow Airport, we installed a giant poster stating "BA Don't Give A Shiatsu." In just five words we showcased our effervescence, cheekiness and great service. That, to me, is what Virgin is all about. It's crucial in this job not to take yourself too seriously and people appreciate it when they see a bit of humor and personality shining through. One thing I've learned over the years is that the average customer is usually far smarter-and more appreciative of a joke-than big businesses give them credit for.<br><br> --------<br><br> When I founded the airline, Lord King from British Airways said that I was "too old to rock, too young to fly." Fifteen years on, where was I now? It was a question I was asking myself, not just from a business sense, but as a father, too. My children, one not yet born, the other tiny when Virgin Atlantic started, were growing up and already making those first steps toward leaving home.<br><br> We had never planned to send the children to boarding school; I had suffered such dreadful experiences there myself. But as Holly approached sixteen we discussed the option seriously. Holly was keen to try out full-term boarding, and we compromised on her going to school in Oxford, which was close to where we lived then, but far enough away for Holly to gain some independence.<br><br> Choosing a school for your children should be a process of careful thought and contemplation: in our case, we managed to find the right choice by getting lost instead. Joan and I had an appointment at a school in Oxford we were considering for Sam and Holly. But having driven to the school, it turned out we had the wrong one altogether.<br><br> Popping inside and realizing it was not an open day, we bumped straight into the headmaster, David Christie. Rather than show us where to go, he insisted on whisking us around on a whirlwind tour of his school instead. The tour and his passion for the school were very impressive indeed. It had, until recently, been an all-boys' school up to sixth grade but was now taking girls. There was a progressive air about the place, an unstuffy feel compared to the crammers I had experienced. By the time we left, both children were bound for St. Edwards. It was a real sliding doors moment in more ways than one: as it turns out, a young boy named Freddie Andrewes, whom Holly would get to know rather well in the coming years, was already studying at St. Edwards.<br><br> When Holly was later named the school's first Head of School, I was overflowing with pride. But I was equally pleased that she was making friends, enjoying herself and growing into a fine young woman. She was already acquiring a taste for tackling injustices, and when she came home bemoaning the fact that girls were not allowed to wear trousers I helped her draft a letter to her headmaster demanding equality for all students. It reminded me of when I was at Stowe School, though in my case I would have campaigned for all students not to wear ties.<br><br> There were some amusing antiquated perks to being Head of School, one of which was the right to be able to graze your own goat in the school grounds.<br><br> "Holly, this is too good an opportunity to miss," I told her over the kitchen table. "Whenever you come across absurd rules, take advantage of them."<br><br> "What do you mean?" she asked.<br><br> "I think you should buy a goat."<br><br> "Don't be silly, Dad," she replied, wisely resisting.<br><br> As Holly prepared to graduate in 2000, we spent an evening hunched over her desk together working on her big speech to the whole school. I went to see her make the speech and was amazed how she had already become a better public speaker than her dad. She was shy, but concentrated on her words and spoke unwaveringly in her beautiful, clear voice. Not for the first or last time, I wept with pride.<br><br> Although sending Holly and Sam to St. Edwards was well worth it, it did take some getting used to the children not being at home. I was accustomed to being away from the kids a little, due to traveling with work so much. For Joan, it was a real wrench-to begin with she would cry every day: she missed her babies so much. She took to driving to Oxford quite a lot, and would "just happen" to pop by the school near midday, and take Holly and Sam out for lunch. Back home, after one of these lunches, there was often no food in the house. I remember standing in the kitchen one evening, rifling through bare cupboards, and saying to Joan: "Look, I know the kids are gone, but we still need to eat!"<br><br> "Well, you know where M&amp;S is, too, Richard," she replied.<br><br> It was a fair point. I got used to driving to Marks &amp; Spencer. But she soon took pity on me!</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Japan</h2><p><p>The ideal travel companion, full of insider advice on what to see and do, plus detailed itineraries and comprehensive maps for exploring this cultured and unique nation.<br><br>Take a guided Tokyo walking tour, bathe in hot springs, hike Japan's mountainous interior or visit peaceful temples: everything you need to know is clearly laid out within color-coded chapters.

He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own hearts in God&#x2019;s love, and learn to live in God&#x2019;s kingdom.&nbsp;John and his wife, Stasi, live near Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>For bestselling evangelical author Eldredge (<i>Wild at Heart</i>), Christians are meant to inherit the kind of intimacy that Adam and Eve had with God in the Garden of Eden, but the belief that God only speaks through the Bible hinders a Christian's ability to experience that intimacy. Drawing from a year's worth of journaling about his walk with God, Eldredge models how talking to God is as easy as checking daily to ask, What are you saying, Lord? Sometimes when Eldredge queries God, God's response confounds him. For example, when God responds repeatedly with two words, My love, it takes an accident and a personal epiphany for Eldredge to understand that God wants him to rebuild [his] personality based on [God's] love. Through everyday life lessons, personal anecdotes and a lot of scripture, Eldredge shows how Christians can get into direct conversation with God, encouraging readers to ask for answers about anything and everything. Eldredge's story (as opposed to chapter) format is supposed to better help readers to pause along the way at those points where God is speaking to you, but it results in a lack of real organization and may make it difficult for readers to uncover an overarching theme in the course of a section. <i>(Apr. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bringing elements of their Polynesian heritage to the American quilt, nineteenth-century Hawaiians created a distinctive and beautiful art form that is still actively practiced throughout the islands. Hawaiian Quilt Masterpieces presents forty-eight remarkable historic and contemporary quilts, all reproduced in full color, that trace the history of the islands: from the early influences of missionaries and traders, to annexation by the United States and subsequent statehood, to the current concerns of today's quilt masters.<br>Hawaii's stunning quilts capture the essence of the islands' overwhelming natural beauty as well as its people's legendary grace and charm. Early quilters developed the beloved Hawaiian applique quilt, its lovely floral designs cut like giant snowflakes from a single piece of cloth. They also created the unique tradition of the flag quilt, made to memorialize the glorious past of the Hawaiian kingdom that fell when the United States annexed the islands in 1898. This volume offers some of the finest examples of the islands' fabric art, highlighted by works of such masterful island quiltmakers as Elizabeth Akana, Sharon Balai, and Junedale Lauwaeomakana Quinories, whose clever variations on classic designs and techniques, spiced with subtle twists of modernity, keep these quilting traditions alive.<br>Hawaiian Quilt Masterpieces is the first new book on the subject in many years and is sure to become a standard reference in the field. If you are a lover of quilts, and if the idyllic geography and fascinating lore of the Hawaiian Islands lures you, then this is the perfect guide to the exotic and beautiful world of Hawaiian quilts.</p><p>Robert Shaw was curator of the Shelburne (VT) Museum from 1981 to 1994."...insightful guide to the vibrant quilts from the islands by leading authority Robert Shaw." ~<i>Detroit News</i><br><br>"Robert Shaw, an expert on American folk art and crafts, provides backstory and historical placement for each quilt, along with an overarching essay on the custom as a whole." ~CoolHunting.com<br><br>&#x201c;Shaw details the history of quiltmaking on the islands and presents 48 Hawaiian quilts dating from the 1880s to the late 1990s.

Lavinia herself never speaks a word. Now, Ursula K. Le Guin gives Lavinia a voice in a novel that takes us to the half-wild world of ancient Italy. Lavinia grows up knowing nothing but peace and freedom until her suitors arrive. Her mother wants her to marry handsome, ambitious Turnus. But omens and prophecies spoken by the sacred springs say she must marry a foreigner, that she will be the cause of a bitter war, and that her husband will not live long. When a fleet of Trojan ships sails up the Tiber, Lavinia decides to take her destiny into her own hands and tells us the story of her life&#x2014;and her life's greatest love.</p></p><p><p>URSULA K. LE GUIN was born in Berkeley, California, in 1929. Among her honors are a National Book Award, five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, the Kafka Award, a Pushcart Prize, and the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Portland, Oregon. <b>www.ursulakleguin.com</b></p>Adult/High School&#x2014;This novel takes a minor character from Vergil's <i>Aeneid</i> and creates a thoughtful, moving tale of prophecy, myth, and self-fulfillment. Lavinia is the teen princess of Latium, a small but important kingdom in pre-Roman Italy. As she moves into womanhood, she feels pressure from her parents to choose one of her many suitors as both her husband and the future ruler of the kingdom. But the oracles of the sacred springs say she will marry an unknown foreigner. This stranger is none other than Vergil's Aeneus, proud hero, king without a country, and the man who will lay down the foundations of the Roman Empire. Their marriage sparks a war to control the region; while readers don't see the glorious battles, they do get the surprisingly moving perspective of the home front through Lavinia's eyes. Best known for her works of fantasy, Le Guin takes a more historical approach here by toning down the magical elements; gods and prophecies have a vital role in the protagonist's life, but they are presented as concepts and rituals, not as deities playing petty games with the lives of mortals. This shifts the focus of Vergil's plot from action to character, allowing Le Guin to breathe life into a character who never utters a word in the original story. Lavinia is quite compelling as she transforms from a spirited princess into a queen full of wisdom who makes a profound impact on her people. The author's language and style are complex, making this a title for sophisticated teens.&#x2014;<i>Matthew L.

How did they mess up so badly? <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry I brought you here,&#x201d; said Nancy.<br>&#x201c;No, no, it&#x2019;s our fault,&#x201d; Jack said again. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine, all mine, oh . . . ,&#x201d; said Nancy. She seemed near tears. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just little kids.&#x201d; Not so little! thought Jack again. Gee!<br>A snowmobile rumbled outside, its engine warming up.<br>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; said Nancy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to lead the group up a safe route to the crater, or they&#x2019;ll be in trouble. But Pete should be back here in just a few minutes. Will you be okay by yourselves till then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be fine, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; said Annie. <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Nancy. &#x201c;Here, sweeties.&#x201d; She poured some water into two cups and gave them to Jack and Annie. &#x201c;Drink.&#x201d; While they drank the water, Nancy spread a blanket on the floor and turned on the small heater.<br>&#x201c;Lie down here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just rest.&#x201d; She patted the blanket.<br>Jack and Annie lay down. Nancy covered them with another blanket. &#x201c;If you get thirsty, drink more water,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Annie. Jack was too embarrassed to say anything. He felt like a preschool kid being put down for a nap.<br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; Nancy said with a big sigh. &#x201c;You kids nearly gave me a heart attack,&#x201d; she repeated half to herself as she left the hut.<br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; said Jack.<br>But Nancy was gone.<br>Soon the roar and rumble of the snowmobiles filled the air as Nancy led the scientists and journalists up the mountain.<br>&#x201c;We really messed up our mission this time,&#x201d; said Jack, lying under the blanket.<br>&#x201c;And we were doing so well, too,&#x201d; said Annie. She sat up. &#x201c;Can I see Morgan&#x2019;s rhyme, please?&#x201d;<br>Jack pulled the rhyme out of his pocket and handed it to Annie. <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Annie. She read aloud:<br>. . . then all fall down,<br>Till you come to the Cave of the Ancient Crown.<br>&#x201c;I wonder if this counts as falling down?&#x201d; said Annie. She put the rhyme into her pocket.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what that means. And there&#x2019;s no &#x2018;Ancient Crown&#x2019; in Antarctica. It&#x2019;s all science and research and rules and helicopters and snowmobiles. . . . It&#x2019;s the real world. . . . His voice trailed off.<br>&#x201c;Well, I know one thing: I don&#x2019;t want to waste time lying around here,&#x201d; said Annie. She threw off the blanket and stood up. &#x201c;At least I can take a few pictures while we wait for Pete.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You really feel like doing that?&#x201d; said Jack.<br>&#x201c;Not really, but I&#x2019;m going to try,&#x201d; said Annie.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should,&#x201d; said Jack.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll be back soon,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll see an ancient crown.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; said Jack.<br>Annie put on her goggles and ski mask and headed outside. <br>Jack reached into his pack and pulled out their book. He took off his glove and looked up ancient crown in the index. He wasn&#x2019;t surprised to find it wasn&#x2019;t there.<br>Jack put the book back in his pack and took out his notebook. He read over his notes:<br><b>Go slow!<br>Stay with others! <br>Cracks in ice!<br>Never touch wildlife!<br></b>Jack&#x2019;s hand was cold, so he put his glove back on. He put away his notebook, and then laid his head back down and closed his eyes. He just wanted to sleep. The heat from the small heater felt good. The sound of the snowmobiles was fading into the distance. As he started to fall asleep, his notes ran through his mind: Stay with others! Cracks in the ice!<br>Oh, no! thought Jack. He sat straight up. He tossed off the blanket. He threw on his pack and rushed out of the hut.<br>The wind was blowing the snow into icy clouds. Jack pulled up his ski mask and lowered his goggles. &#x201c;Annie!&#x201d; he shouted.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Her voice came from the distance. <br>Jack caught sight of her. She was aiming her camera up the slope at the smoking crater of the mountain. <br>&#x201c;You have to come back now!&#x201d; he shouted, walking toward her. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be walking around by yourself!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, okay.&#x201d; Annie put her camera in her pocket. <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; said Jack. He took Annie&#x2019;s hand. They held on to each other and walked through the blowing snow, toward the hut. &#x201c;Remember Nancy&#x2019;s rules?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;There are deep cracks in&#x2013; AHHH!&#x201d; <br>Before Jack could finish, the ground beneath him gave way and he and Annie crashed through a thin layer of snow into a deep crack. <br>Jack and Annie landed on a ledge of ice. Clumps of snow fell on top of them. Silence filled the air. A thin shaft of light came from the opening they had fallen through. It was at least ten feet above them. <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Jack said. <br>&#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; said Annie. <br>They both sat up slowly. Annie peered over the edge of the ledge. &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br>Jack looked. He and Annie were on the ledge of a ravine that plunged thousands of feet down into darkness. <br>&#x201c;This must be one of those hidden places in the mountain Nancy talked about,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;the ones made by the lava and hot gases.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredible,&#x201d; said Annie. She reached into her pocket for her camera.<br>As soon as Annie moved, Jack heard the ice crack. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move!&#x201d; he said. <br>Annie froze.<br>&#x201c;Forget pictures,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re facing serious danger here. If we move, the ice might break under us and we&#x2019;ll fall thousands of feet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; said Annie.

We can only use it for the good of others, not just ourselves.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Darn,&#x201d; said Annie.<br>They were both still for moment, listening to the immense silence around them.<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;The way I see it, if we don&#x2019;t use the wand, we&#x2019;ll be stuck here forever.

Then he opened his eyes and looked around. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; said Annie.<br>&#x201c;So I guess it didn&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; said Jack.

The answers are here in this book. They are geological terms that reflect a bond between wine and the land. Understanding geology, however, is tricky. Geological concepts are obscure; processes can be imperceptibly slow, invisible, and unimaginably ancient. The terminology is formidable, such that even the names of common rocks carry an air of mystery. <br> <br>Geology is introduced plainly, starting with basic principles, all in the context of wine. The emphasis is on the kinds of processes that shape vineyards, and on the minerals, rocks and soils that host the vines. Geological words now commonly seen in wine writings are systematically explained. You will learn the stories behind some of the names, the human face of geology. <br><br>The book also explores how the geology-wine connection manifests in the finished product and evaluates its importance, particularly in the contexts of minerality, terroir, and wine taste. The fact is that geology is increasingly being promoted in the world of wine; the aim here is to help it be properly understood.<br></p><p><br>Alex Maltman is Emeritus Professor of Earth Sciences at Aberystwyth University, in Wales, U.K. Alongside a long and decorated research and teaching career in Geology, for over forty years he has grown vines and made wine as a hobby.<br><br>"No student of wine should be without this book; every wine writer and sommelier should read it several times. Supposing that we all do this, the language and discourse of wine will move forward." --Andrew Jefford, <em>Decanter Magazine</em><p></p><br>"In contrast to previous books on wine and geology, Maltman actually aims to evaluate how geology might be relevant to wine. He is well qualified for the task, with experience growing his own vines and a university career in teaching and research in geology." --Michael Summerfield, <em>The World of Fine</em> <em>Wine Magazine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Nelson&#39;s Compact Series: Compact Bible Commentary</h2><p><p>The ability to translate scripture into modern-day application is at your fingertips.

Jazzlife (Multilingual Edition)</h2><p><p>In 1960, photographer William Claxton and noted musicologist Joachim Berendt traveled the United States hot on the trail of jazz. Through music halls and marching bands, side streets and subways, they sought to document this living, breathing, beating musical phenomenon that enraptured America across social, economic, and racial lines.</p><p>The result of Claxton and Berendt&#x2019;s collaboration was Jazzlife, much sought after by collectors and now revived in this fresh TASCHEN volume. From coast to coast, from unknown street performers to legends of the genre, this defining jazz journey explores just what made up this most original of American art forms. In New Orleans and New York, in St. Louis, Biloxi, Jackson, and beyond, Claxton&#x2019;s rapturous yet tender images and accompanying texts examine jazz&#x2019;s regional diversity as much as its pervasive vitality and soul. They show the music makers and the many spaces and people this music touched, from funeral parades to concert stages, from an elderly trumpet player to kids who hung from windows to catch a glimpse of a passing band.</p><p>With images of Charlie Parker, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Muddy Waters, Gabor Szabo, Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and many more, this is as much a compelling slice of history as it is a loving personal tribute.</p></p><p>Joachim E.

Gibbons again uses clear blues and greens and soft grays, but her palette is modified here with browns, startling touches of pink, orange, and yellow, and a sharp reduction of the frothy white of the earlier book. A few illustrations show sharks in somewhat contorted positions, giving odd angles to caudal appendages. The information is specific and generally accurate, although sources consulted referred to months rather than the ``few weeks'' Gibbons gives sharks' ``thorny cased eggs'' to develop and hatch. The data is often quite complex, and may be beyond a portion of the audience to which this format will have the most appeal. More informative than Cole's Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Random, 1986) or Selsam's A First Look at Sharks (Walker, 1979), this book is on par with Waters's Sea Full of Sharks (Scholastic, 1990).

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Massey was one of the first Egyptologists in modern times to suggest that with the final eclipse of the old Land of Kam [a.k.a. ancient Egypt], a brilliant light had been extinguished in world civilization. There was a small compensation in the often meteoric rise of other cultures subsequently, but the luminance of these later cultures was, Massey suggests, a paler reflection of the Nile Valley sun that had set. In this, the most philosophical of his works on ancient Egypt, Massey leads a tour through thousands of years of sociological, cultural, and spiritual development, all the while pointing, with dazzling reason and persuasive prose, to a distant, common, Egyptian origin. In the first volume Massey was primarily interested in elaborating how the first humans emerging in Africa created thought. What had been evident to him from the outset was that the myths, rituals and religion of ancient Egypt--or Old Kam--had preserved virtually intact a record of the psycho-mythic evolution of humanity. In the second volume Massey examines the celestial phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes. He believed that only by understanding this phenomenon was it possible to fathom Nile Valley history. The last half of the second volume is devoted to the Kamite sources of Christianity. Massey sought to demonstrate the manner in which New Testament Christianity evolved directly out of Osirian mysteries. One of the more important aspects of Massey&#39;s writings were his assertions that there were parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian god Horus. Massey, for example, argued that: both Horus and Jesus were born of virgins on 25 December, raised men from the dead (Massey speculates that the biblical Lazarus, raised from the dead by Jesus, has a parallel in El-Asar-Us, a title of Osiris), died by crucifixion and were resurrected three days later. These assertions have influenced various later writers such as Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Tom Harpur, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, and D.M. Murdock.</p><p></p><h2>Phantom of the Auditorium (Classic Goosebumps #20) (20)</h2><p>Get Goosebumps with the startling repackage of a bestselling classic.

The industry must learn to operate in a fundamentally different way if there is any hope of delivering safer, more reliable, higher quality care with improved patient and staff experience&#x2014;and accomplish all of this at the lowest possible cost. <i>Advanced Lean in Healthcare</i> is a practical guide for anyone in the healthcare industry. The book presents a novel approach to creating an advanced operating system, breaking it down into simple-to-understand steps.</p> <p>Borrowing from a business system with its roots in manufacturing, <i>Advanced Lean in Healthcare</i> narrates a healthcare industry operational problem through the experience of a patient: a young boy ravaged by terminal illness. By putting a real-world lens on the situation, the book takes the reader through five levels of the increasingly advanced steps of a lean transformation, giving them a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the required operational and management shifts. By introducing lean strategies one-by-one, the authors provide an easy-to-understand plan for providing higher quality care, improved patient and staff experience, and significant cost savings for healthcare organizations.</p> <p>At its core, lean is a business strategy that aims to increase customer satisfaction and improve staff and corporate productivity by reducing the amount of non-value added work (waste). By engaging everyone in an organization in problem solving to reduce waste, the efficiency and quality of patient care can be optimized. In addition, engaging the entire workforce produces harder-to-quantify results, such as improved morale and greater organizational capability for future problem solving and growth.</p> <p><i>Advanced Lean in Healthcare</i> introduces the various terms and methodologies of lean and compares them side-by-side with more traditional methods, demonstrating how the five level operating system stacks up against the status quo. In addition, a multitude of colored graphs, photographs, and lists are used to demonstrate and augment the detailed text. By providing specific examples of what works and what doesn&#x2019;t work, the authors make the transformation to a lean system an attainable goal for any organization that is truly committed to change and continuous improvement. The five levels are divided into ten chapters, each building on its predecessor, to provide a clear framework from beginning to end, which healthcare organizations can adapt to their own needs.</p> <p>The end result is a framework that is accessible by anyone in the healthcare industry&#x2014;including physicians, nurses, technicians, managers, and executives&#x2014;to create a true transformational shift in their daily operations, making their organization run better, more efficiently, and more affordably, all while maintaining the highest standard of quality and service.</p></p><p><b>Craig T.

Where other texts suggest ways to optimize performance inside the existing paradigm, Uncharitable suggests that the paradigm itself is the problem and calls into question our fundamental canons about charity. Author Dan Pallotta argues that society&#x2019;s nonprofit ethic acts as a strict regulatory mechanism on the natural economic law. It creates an economic apartheid that denies the nonprofit sector critical tools and permissions that the for-profit sector is allowed to use without restraint (e.g., no risk-reward incentives, no profit, counterproductive limits on compensation, and moral objections to the use of donated dollars for anything other than program expenditures). These double-standards place the nonprofit sector at extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector on every level. While the for profit sector is permitted to use all the tools of capitalism to advance the sale of consumer goods, the nonprofit sector is prohibited from using any of them to fight hunger or disease. Capitalism is blamed for creating the inequities in our society, but charity is prohibited from using the tools of capitalism to rectify them. Ironically, this is all done in the name of charity, but it is a charity whose principal benefit flows to the for-profit sector and one that denies the nonprofit sector the tools and incentives that have built virtually everything of value in society. The very ethic we have cherished as the hallmark of our compassion is in fact what undermines it. This irrational system, Pallotta explains, has its roots in 400-year-old Puritan ethics that banished self-interest from the realm of charity. The ideology is policed today by watchdog agencies and the use of &#x201c;efficiency&#x201d; measures, which Pallotta argues are flawed, unjust, and should be abandoned. By declaring our independence from these obsolete ideas, Pallotta theorizes, we can dramatically accelerate progress on the most urgent social issues of our time. Pallotta has written an important, provocative, timely, and accessible book&#x2015;a manifesto about equal economic rights for charity. Its greatest contribution may be to awaken society to the fact that they were so unequal in the first place.</p><p>DAN PALLOTTA founded Pallotta Team-Works, the company that invented the AIDS Rides and Breast Cancer 3-Day events, which raised over half a billion dollars and netted $305 million in nine years&#x2015;more money, raised more quickly for these causes than any known private event operation in history. 182,000 people participated in the events. The company had more than 350 full-time employees in sixteen U.S. offices, was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study, and fundamentally re-invented the paradigm for special event fundraising in America.Pallotta TeamWorks was the for-profit brainchild behind several campaigns to raise funds for breast cancer and AIDS research and awareness, creating several nationwide, marathonlike events that raised millions. But its founder came under attack for violating the sacred premises of charitable organizations: low profile, low budget, and little or no profit. Pallotta turns on its head the assumption that charity and capitalism should be forever divided. Don&#x2019;t charitable causes deserve the same kind of competitive forces that work to get results in the for-profit sector? Wouldn&#x2019;t social causes be better served if charitable organizations were headed by the kind of bright, aggressive executives that work in the for-profit sector? Pallotta traces the history of nonprofit organizations to Puritan notions of charity and self-denial. He also offers a detailed case study of TeamWorks and other trends in the nonprofit sector that only tweak around the edges of a system that is sorely in need of change if it is to deliver on its mission to improve social inequities or cure diseases.&nbsp;A passionate, thought-provoking look at the nonprofit sector. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>King Solomon&#39;s Mines (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The first great "Lost World" action-adventure, a precursor to Indiana Jones</b> <br><br> H.

I wonder what sort of a history it will be when I have finished it, if ever I come to the end of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life, which seems a long one to me, owing to my having begun work so young, perhaps. At an age when other boys are at school I was earning my living as a trader in the old Colony. I have been trading, hunting, fighting, or mining ever since. And yet it is only eight months ago that I made my pile. It is a big pile now that I have got it-I don't yet know how big-but I do not think I would go through the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it; no, not if I knew that I should come out safe at the end, pile and all. But then I am a timid man, and dislike violence, and, moreover, I am fairly sick of adventure. I wonder why I am going to write this book: it is not in my line. I am not a literary man, though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the "Ingoldsby Legends." Let me try to set down my reasons, just to see if I have any.<br><br>First reason: Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked me to.<br><br>Second reason: Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain in my left leg. Ever since that confounded lion got hold of me I have been liable to this trouble, and its being rather bad just now makes me limp more than ever. There must be some poison in a lion's teeth, otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again, generally, mark you, at the same time of year that you got your mauling? It is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions and more, as I have in the course of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco. It breaks the routine of the thing, and putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man and don't like that. This is by the way.<br><br>Third reason: Because I want my boy Harry, who is over there at the hospital in London studying to become a doctor, to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so. Hospital work must sometimes pall and grow rather dull, for even of cutting up dead bodies there may come satiety, and as this history will not be dull, whatever else it may be, it will put a little life into things for a day or two while Harry is reading it.<br><br>Fourth reason and last: Because I am going to tell the strangest story that I know of. It may seem a queer thing to say, especially considering that there is no woman in it-except Foulata. Stop, though! there is Gagaoola, if she was a woman and not a fiend. But she was a hundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don't count her. At any rate, I can safely say that there is not a petticoat in the whole history. Well, I had better come to the yoke. It is a stiff place, and I feel as though I were bogged up to the axle. But "sutjes, sutjes," as the Boers say-I am sure I don't know how they spell it-softly does it. A strong team will come through at last, that is, if they are not too poor. You can never do anything with poor oxen. Now to begin.<br><br>I, Allan Quatermain, of Durban, Natal, Gentleman, make oath and say-That's how I began my deposition before the magistrate about poor Khiva's and Ventv�gel's sad deaths; but somehow it doesn't seem quite the right way to begin a book. And, besides, am I a gentleman? What is a gentleman? I don't quite know, and yet I have had to do with niggers-no, I will scratch out that word "niggers," for I do not like it. I've known natives who are, and so you will say, Harry, my boy, before you have done with this tale, and I have known mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home, too, who are not. Well, at any rate, I was born a gentleman, though I have been nothing but a poor travelling trader and hunter all my life. Whether I have remained so I know not, you must judge of that. Heaven knows I've tried. I have killed many men in my time, yet I have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent blood, but only in self-defence. The Almighty gave us our lives, and I suppose He meant us to defend them, at least I have always acted on that, and I hope it will not be brought up against me when my clock strikes. There, there, it is a cruel and a wicked world, and for a timid man I have been mixed up in a deal of slaughter. I cannot tell the rights of it, but at any rate I have never stolen, though once I cheated a Kafir out of a herd of cattle. But then he had done me a dirty turn, and it has troubled me ever since into the bargain.<br><br>Well, it is eighteen months or so ago since first I met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and it was in this way. I had been up elephant hunting beyond Bamangwato, and had met with bad luck. Everything went wrong that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly. So soon as I was well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory as I had, together with my wagon and oxen, discharged my hunters, and took the post-cart to the Cape. After spending a week in Cape Town, finding that they overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen everything there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country, and the new Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do nothing of the sort, I determined to go back to Natal by the Dunkeld, then lying at the docks waiting for the Edinburgh Castle due in from England. I took my berth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the Edinburgh Castle transhipped, and we weighed and put out to sea.<br><br>Among the passengers who came on board there were two who excited my curiosity. One, a gentleman of about thirty, was per- haps the biggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw. He had yellow hair, a thick yellow beard, clear-cut features, and large grey eyes set deep into his head. I never saw a finer-looking man, and somehow he reminded me of an ancient Dane. Not that I know much of ancient Danes, though I knew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds; but I remember once seeing a picture of some of those gentry, who, I take it, were a kind of white Zulus. They were drinking out of big horns, and their long hair hung down their backs, and as I looked at my friend standing there by the companion-ladder, I thought that if he only let his hair grow a little, put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders, and took hold of a battle-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that picture. And by the way it is a curious thing, and just shows how the blood will out, I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that was the big man's name, is of Danish blood.* He also reminded me strongly of somebody else, but at the time I could not remember who it was.<br><br>The other man who stood talking to Sir Henry was short, stout, and dark, and of quite a different cut. I suspected at once that he was a naval officer; I don't know why, but it is difficult to mistake a navy man. I have gone on shooting trips with several of them in the course of my life, and they have always proved themselves the best and bravest and nicest fellows I ever met, though given to the use of profane language.<br><br>I asked a page or two back, what is a gentleman? I'll answer it now: a Royal Naval officer is, in a general sort of a way, though of course there may be a black sheep among them here and there. I fancy it is just the wide seas and the breath of God's winds that wash their hearts and blow the bitterness out of their minds and make them what men ought to be. Well, to return, I was right again; I ascertained that he was a naval officer, a lieutenant of thirty-one, who, after seventeen years' service, had been turned out of her Majesty's employ with the barren honour of a commander's rank, because it was impossible that he should be promoted. This is what people who serve the Queen have to expect: to be shot out into the <br><br>*&nbsp;Mr. Quatermain's ideas about ancient Danes seem to be rather confused; we have always understood that they were dark-haired people. Probably he was thinking of Saxons. -Editor.<br><br>cold world to find a living just when they are beginning to really understand their work, and to reach the prime of life. Well, I suppose they don't mind it, but for my part I had rather earn my bread as a hunter. One's halfpence are as scarce perhaps, but you do not get so many kicks. His name I found out-by referring to the passengers' list-was Good-Captain John Good. He was broad, of medium height, dark, stout, and rather a curious man to look at. He was so very neat and so very clean shaved, and he always wore an eye-glass in his right eye. It seemed to grow there, for it had no string, and he never took it out except to wipe it. At first I thought he used to sleep in it, but I afterwards found that this was a mistake. He put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed, together with his false teeth, of which he had two beautiful sets that, my own being none of the best, have often caused me to break the tenth commandment. But I am anticipating.<br><br>Soon after we had got under weigh evening closed in, and brought with it very dirty weather. A keen breeze sprang up off land, and a kind of aggravated Scotch mist soon drove everybody from the deck. As for the Dunkeld, she is a flat-bottomed punt, and going up light as she was, she rolled very heavily. It almost seemed as though she would go right over, but she never did. It was quite impossible to walk about, so I stood near the engines where it was warm, and amused myself with watching the pendulum, which was fixed opposite to me, swinging slowly backwards and forwards as the vessel rolled, and marking the angle she touched at each lurch.<br><br>"That pendulum's wrong; it is not properly weighted," suddenly said a voice at my shoulder somewhat testily. Looking round I saw the naval officer whom I had noticed when the passengers came aboard.<br><br>"Indeed, now what makes you think so?" I asked.<br><br>"Think so. I don't think at all. Why there"-as she righted herself after a roll-"if the ship had really rolled to the degree that thing pointed to then she would never have rolled again, that's all. But it is just like these merchant skippers, they always are so confoundedly careless."<br><br>Just then the dinner-bell rang, and I was not sorry, for it is a dreadful thing to have to listen to an officer of the Royal Navy when he gets on to that subject. I only know one worse thing, and it is to hear a merchant skipper express his candid opinion of officers of the Royal Navy.<br><br>Captain Good and I went down to dinner together, and there we found Sir Henry Curtis already seated. He and Captain Good were placed together, and I sat opposite to them. The captain and I soon fell into talk about shooting and what not; he asking me many questions, and I answering them as well as I could. Presently he got on to elephants.<br><br>"Ah, sir," called out somebody who was sitting near me, "you've reached the right man for that; Hunter Quatermain should be able to tell you about elephants if anybody can."<br><br>Sir Henry, who had been sitting quite quiet listening to our talk, started visibly.<br><br>"Excuse me, sir," he said, leaning forward across the table, and speaking in a low deep voice, a very suitable voice, it seemed to me, to come out of those great lungs. "Excuse me, sir, but is your name Allan Quatermain?"<br><br>I said that it was.<br><br>The big man made no further remark, but I heard him mutter "fortunate" into his beard.<br><br>Presently dinner came to an end, and as we were leaving the saloon Sir Henry strolled up and asked me if I would come into his cabin to smoke a pipe. I accepted, and he led the way to the Dunkeld deck cabin, and a very good cabin it is. It had been two cabins, but when Sir Garnet or one of those big swells went down the coast in the Dunkeld, they knocked away the partition and have never put it up again. There was a sofa in the cabin, and a little table in front of it. Sir Henry sent the steward for a bottle of whisky, and the three of us sat down and lit our pipes.<br><br>"Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry Curtis, when the steward had brought the whisky and lit the lamp, "the year before last about this time you were, I believe, at a place called Bamangwato, to the north of the Transvaal."<br><br>"I was," I answered, rather surprised that this gentleman should be so well acquainted with my movements, which were not, so far as I was aware, considered of general interest.<br><br>"You were trading there, were you not?" put in Captain Good, in his quick way.<br><br>"I was. I took up a wagon-load of goods, made a camp outside the settlement, and stopped till I had sold them."</p><h2>Oxford IB Diploma Programme IB Mathematics: analysis and approaches, Standard Level, Print and Enhanced Online Course Book Pack</h2><p>Featuring a wealth of digital content, this concept-based Print and Enhanced Online Course Book Pack has been developed in cooperation with the IB to provide the most comprehensive support for the new DP Mathematics: analysis and approaches SL syllabus, for first teaching in September 2019.

The book explains how organizational missions and cultures create the labyrinth in which a coherent national security policy must be fashioned. Understanding and appreciating these organizations and their cultures is essential for formulating and implementing it. Taking into account the changes introduced by the Obama administration, the second edition includes four new or entirely revised chapters (Congress, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury, and USAID) and updates to the text throughout. It covers changes instituted since the first edition was published in 2011, implications of the government campaign to prosecute leaks, and lessons learned from more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

When Rom�o Dallaire was called on to serve as force commander of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda, he believed that his assignment was to help two warring parties achieve the peace they both wanted. Instead, he was exposed to the most barbarous and chaotic display of civil war and genocide in the past decade, observing in just one hundred days the killings of more than eight hundred thousand Rwandans. With only a few troops, his own ingenuity and courage to direct his efforts, Dallaire rescued thousands, but his call for more support from the world body fell on deaf ears. In Shake Hands with the Devil, General Dallaire recreates the awful history the world community chose to ignore. He also chronicles his own progression from confident Cold Warrior to devastated UN commander, and finally to retired general struggling painfully, and publicly, to overcome posttraumatic stress disorder&#x2014;the highest-ranking officer ever to share such experiences with readers.</p><p>On the tenth anniversary of the date that UN peacekeepers landed in Rwanda, Random House Canada is proud to publish the unforgettable first-hand account of the genocide by the man who led the UN mission. Digging deep into shattering memories, General Dallaire has written a powerful story of betrayal, na�vet�, racism and international politics. His message is simple and undeniable: ?Never again.? <br> <br>When Lt-Gen. Rom�o Dallaire received the call to serve as force commander of the UN intervention in Rwanda in 1993, he thought he was heading off on a modest and straightforward peacekeeping mission. Thirteen months later he flew home from Africa, broken, disillusioned and suicidal, having witnessed the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandans in only a hundred days. In Shake Hands with the Devil, he takes the reader with him on a return voyage into the hell of Rwanda, vividly recreating the events the international community turned its back on. This book is an unsparing eyewitness account of the failure by humanity to stop the genocide, despite timely warnings. <br> <br>Woven through the story of this disastrous mission is Dallaire?s own journey from confident Cold Warrior, to devastated UN commander, to retired general engaged in a painful struggle to find a measure of peace, reconciliation and hope. This book is General Dallaire?s personal account of his conversion from a man certain of his worth and secure in his assumptions to a man conscious of his own weaknesses and failures and critical of the institutions he?d relied on. It might not sit easily with standard ideas of military leadership, but understanding what happened to General Dallaire and his mission to Rwanda is crucial to understanding the moral minefields our peacekeepers are forced to negotiate when we ask them to step into the world?s dirty wars. <br> <br> <b>Excerpt from <i>Shake Hands with the Devil</i></b> <br> <i>My story is not a strictly military account nor a clinical, academic study of the breakdown of Rwanda. It is not a simplistic indictment of the many failures of the UN as a force for peace in the world. It is not a story of heroes and villains, although such a work could easily be written. This book is a cri de coeur for the slaughtered thousands, a tribute to the souls hacked apart by machetes because of their supposed difference from those who sought to hang on to power. . . . This book is the account of a few humans who were entrusted with the role of helping others taste the fruits of peace. Instead, we watched as the devil took control of paradise on earth and fed on the blood of the people we were supposed to protect.</i>LT. GEN. ROM�O DALLAIRE joined the Canadian Army in 1964.

He&#x2019;d arranged this trip because their last adventure to the Solomon Islands had not been the hoped-for quiet vacation they&#x2019;d planned. &#x201c;I promise you nothing but rest, relaxation, and a week of no one trying to kill us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A whole week of downtime,&#x201d; she said, sidling closer to him as a cloud drifted over the sun, taking with it all the warmth of the early-September afternoon. &#x201c;Have we had anything like that in a while?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that I can remember.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There it is,&#x201d; she said, spying the bookstore. The flaking gold-leafed lettering in the window read <i>Pickering&#x2019;s</i> <i>Used &amp; Rare Books</i>. &#x201c;Just to show how very much I appreciate you traipsing all this way with me, I won&#x2019;t make you come in.&#x201d; Remi was be-ing&nbsp;facetious. Sam&#x2019;s late father, a NASA engineer, had collected rare books, and Sam, also an engineer, had inherited that same passion.<br><br>He eyed the bookstore, then his wife. &#x201c;What sort of husband would I be if something happened to you in there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dangerous things, books.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look what they did to your brain.&#x201d;<br><br>The pair crossed the street to the bookstore. A Siamese cat, resting on a stack of volumes in the window, looked up in disdain when a bell tinkled as Sam opened the door for Remi. The place smelled of musk and old paper, and Remi scanned the shelves, at first seeing nothing but used hardcovers and current paperbacks. She hid her disappointment from Sam, hoping they hadn&#x2019;t made the trip for nothing.<br><br>A gray-haired man, wearing gold spectacles, wandered in from the back, wiping his hands on a dusty cloth. He saw them and smiled. &#x201c;May I help you find something?&#x201d;<br><br>Sam&#x2019;s phone rang. He took it from his pocket, telling Remi, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it outside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect, since this was meant to be a surprise.&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped out, and Remi waited until the door closed firmly behind him before turning to the proprietor. &#x201c;Mr. Pickering?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I was told you had a copy of <i>The History of Pyrates and Privateers</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>His smile faltered for the barest of instances. &#x201c;Of course. Right over here.&#x201d;<br><br>Pickering led her to a shelf where several identical volumes of <i>Pyrates and Privateers</i> sat. And while they were clearly reproductions, their faux gold-tooled leather binding gave them the appearance of something that might be found in a library centuries before.<br><br>He slid a copy from the shelf, used his cloth to wipe the dust from the top of it, then handed it to her. &#x201c;How did you know we carried this particular volume?&#x201d;<br><br>She decided to keep it vague&#x2014;not wanting there to be any hurt feelings now that she knew the book was merely a reproduction. &#x201c;A woman I work with knew of my husband&#x2019;s interest in lost artifacts and rare books.&#x201d; She opened the cover, admiring the detail that gave it an antiqued appearance. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful copy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Just not what I was hoping for.&#x201d;<br><br>He pushed his spectacles up onto the bridge of his nose. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s popular with interior designers. Less emphasis on lost artifacts and more on decorating a coffee table. I do, on occasion, run across old volumes of historical significance. Perhaps your friend meant the Charles Johnson volumes on <i>A General History of Pyrates</i>? That, I do have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As do we. I was hoping for <i>Pyrates and Privateers</i> to round out our collection. My friend, no doubt, confused the two titles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who did you say referred you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bree Marshall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Well, that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; A whoosh of air and the tinkling of the bell seemed to startle him, and he and Remi turned toward the door at the same time. Remi, expecting Sam, saw a much shorter, broad-shouldered man silhouetted against the light from the shop&#x2019;s window.<br><br>The bookseller eyed the man, then smiled at Remi. &#x201c;Let me get the dust off of it and wrap it for you.&#x201d; And before she could object, tell him she really had no interest in buying a reproduction, he swept the book from her hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend Bree had clearly misunderstood which book her uncle had in his shop. No matter. It was a beautiful copy and would look nice in Sam&#x2019;s office. He&#x2019;d certainly appreciate the sentiment, she decided as she turned to browse the shelves while waiting, spying a copy of Galeazzi&#x2019;s eighteenth-century music treatise. It appeared to be a first edition, and she couldn&#x2019;t imagine why it was sitting in a simple locked glass case at the front counter.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you work here?&#x201d; the man asked.<br><br>She turned, caught a glimpse of dark hair, brown eyes, and a square-set jaw, as he moved from the backlighting of the window. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. No. He&#x2019;s in the back. Wrapping a gift for me.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded, then walked past the aisle out of sight. When Mr. Pickering emerged from the back room, he walked around the counter to the register. The man stood off to one side, his hands shoved into the pockets of his black leather coat. His presence bothered Remi, though for no reason she could determine except perhaps the way he seemed to be watching their every move&#x2014;and that he never took his hands from his pockets. She didn&#x2019;t like it when she couldn&#x2019;t see someone&#x2019;s hands.<br><br>Mr. Pickering slid her brown paper parcel onto the counter, his gnarled fingers shaking slightly. Nerves or age? she wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How much do I owe you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Right. Forty-nine ninety-five. Plus tax. No charge for the gift wrapping.&#x201d;<br><br>Not quite the wrapping she would have chosen. Aloud, she said, &#x201c;On the good-news front, it&#x2019;s definitely less than I&#x2019;d anticipated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Printed in China,&#x201d; he said, offering her a nervous smile.<br><br>She paid him, then tucked the parcel beneath her arm. The Siamese, on its windowed perch by the door, peered over at her, its tail twitching. Remi reached down and petted it, the cat purring, as she stole a glance at the stranger, who hadn&#x2019;t moved.<br><br>He pulled a gun from his coat pocket and pointed it at them. &#x201c;Lady, you should&#x2019;ve left when you had a chance. Keep your hands where I can see them.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Two</i><br><br>Sam finished his phone call with the hotel manager, who confirmed that the champagne on ice and gift for Remi had been delivered to their suite as ordered. Sam checked his watch, then glanced over at the bookstore, wondering what was taking Remi so long. Knowing her, she was probably having a lively discussion on some obscure topic with the bookseller and that customer who&#x2019;d walked in shortly after. She&#x2019;d been excited about the prospect of searching for this mystery book&#x2014;something she was certain he&#x2019;d want to add to his collection. But, -really, how long could it take to find the thing and pay for it?<br><br>Time to urge Remi to shop a little faster or that champagne was bound to be room temperature by the time they made it back. He peered into the window, seeing no one, not even the cat who&#x2019;d been perched on the books by the door. What he did see was Remi&#x2019;s purse sitting atop a wrapped parcel on the counter.<br><br>Not like her to leave her purse, he thought, and opened the door, the bells jingling as he stepped in. &#x201c;Remi?&#x201d;<br><br>The shop appeared empty.<br><br>&#x201c;Remi?&#x201d;<br><br>He eyed her unattended purse, then walked through the store, looking down each aisle, finally finding her standing in the doorway of what appeared to be an office or storage area at the back of the shop. &#x201c;There you are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to wait outside. Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I found that cookbook I&#x2019;ve been searching for. The owner&#x2019;s wrapping it up for me. Now, leave or you&#x2019;ll ruin your surprise.&#x201d;<br><br>He stared for a second or two, unable to read anything on her face, her green eyes about as expressive as a poker player&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait outside,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled sweetly at him, never moving from the doorway. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>He retraced his steps. The door bells jangled overhead as he opened, then shut, the door, remaining inside the store.<br><br>While Remi wasn&#x2019;t exactly a stranger in the kitchen, she often joked that <i>cook</i> was a noun, not a verb.<br><br>Come to think of it, he couldn&#x2019;t recall her <i>ever</i> buying a cookbook, much less searching for one. Definitely not while they were married.<br><br>She was in trouble.<br><br>Nice time to be without a gun.<br><br>Typically, he carried a Smith &amp; Wesson&nbsp;.357 Magnum, but they were in San Francisco for fun and so he&#x2019;d left it on their plane.<br><br>Now what? Call 911 and hope the police arrived in time?<br><br>Not about to risk his wife&#x2019;s life, he silenced the ringer on his phone, set his hat on the counter, then quietly began opening drawers, searching for something a little more substantial than his small pocketknife to use as a weapon. He found a folding knife with a four-inch blade. He pulled it open, felt it lock. Decent weight, nicely balanced, point intact, probably used to open boxes, judging by the gumminess on the blade&#x2019;s edge. Now to get back to that room without being discovered.<br><br>He slid his hand into his wife&#x2019;s purse, found a small makeup bag, and took out a compact mirror. Flipping it open, he wiped the powder residue from the mirror with his pants, then edged his way down the aisle, making sure a row of bookshelves was between him and the door to that storeroom.<br><br>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; a deep voice shouted.<br><br>Sam froze.<br><br>&#x201c;Forget the combination again and you die.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me.&#x201d; Pickering, the bookseller, Sam figured, as he continued down the aisle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nervous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Remi said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to wave that gun around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up! You, old man. Get that safe open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam forced himself to breathe evenly. His wife was in that room, and all he wanted to do was rush in there, save her. But his haste could mean her death. A folding knife against a gunman. It was moments like this he was glad for the weapons-and-security training he&#x2019;d received during his years at DARPA.<br><br>When he reached the end of the aisle, he stopped, used the mirror to peer around the corner.<br><br>Light spilled from the doorway of the storeroom onto the gray linoleum floor. Sam kept to the edge, careful not to cast a shadow. Holding the mirror out, he angled it to get a visual into the room.<br><br>Relief at the sight of his auburn-haired wife, now seated by a cluttered desk, was short-lived as he angled the compact farther and saw the short, swarthy fellow holding a semiauto to the shopkeeper&#x2019;s back. The two men stood in front of a large floor safe, the shopkeeper turning the dial. If Sam approached from this position, it put Remi between him and the gunman.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t like the odds. At the moment, he had no other choice.<br><br>C&#x2019;mon, Remi. Turn. See me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>He rocked the tiny mirror back and forth so that the light caught her face. Unfortunately, she looked away, leaning toward the desk, as an audible click indicated the safe had unlocked. Pickering pulled open the door, revealing a smooth wooden box large enough to hold two bottles of wine.<br><br>The gunman stepped closer to it. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in the box?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An old book. Just an antique.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Put it on the desk.&#x201d;<br><br>He complied, placing the box on the desk near Remi.<br><br>Sam grasped the handle-heavy knife by its blade, stepped into the doorway, aimed, and threw.<br><br>The timing couldn&#x2019;t have been worse.<br><br>At that very moment, Remi jumped from her chair and swung the brass desk lamp against the gunman&#x2019;s hand. Sam&#x2019;s knife struck the man&#x2019;s shoulder. A shot cracked the air as he twisted, his gun flying from his hand.<br><br>Sam rushed in. The gunman pushed Pickering onto Remi, then grabbed the box. He slammed it into Sam&#x2019;s head as he ran past and out the door.<br><br>Sam wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was the jangling of bells as the front door opened or the blow to his head causing the ringing.<br><br>&#x201c;Sam&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;<br><br>It was a second before he realized his wife was speaking to him. &#x201c;Everyone okay?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Are <i>you</i> okay?&#x201d; she replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He reached up, touched his head, his fingers covered in blood. &#x201c;Looks like I came in second.&#x201d;<br><br>Remi set the gun on the desk, then pushed him into the chair she&#x2019;d been sitting in moments before. Placing both hands on his cheeks, her skin warm, soft, she leaned down, searched his eyes, as if to ensure that he really was okay. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always first in my book. Ambulance?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, took a closer look at his head, then turned toward the bookseller, who was using the desk to pull himself to his feet. &#x201c;Mr. Pickering. Let me help you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mr. Wickham?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Wickham?&#x201d; Remi asked.<br><br>&#x201c;My cat. Wickham&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? Here, kitty, kitty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; A moment later, the Siamese wandered into the storeroom, and Pickering scooped it up.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Remi said, &#x201c;everyone accounted for. Time to call the police.&#x201d;<br><br>Pickering eyed the phone as she put the receiver to her ear. &#x201c;Is that necessary?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; she replied, pressing 911 on the keypad.<br><br>The police arrived about five minutes later, sirens blaring, even though she told them the robber had left.<br><br>One of the officers drew Sam aside to take his statement. When he&#x2019;d finished, the officer asked Sam to show him where the gunman had been standing when his weapon discharged. Sam positioned himself next to the desk, then demonstrated the man&#x2019;s movement as Remi bashed his hand with the lamp. The officer stood where Sam stood, looking around. &#x201c;And where were you when you threw the knife?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the doorway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stand there, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam did so.<br><br>The officer walked over, placed his finger on the doorframe. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where the bullet hit.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam looked over, realized it was just a few inches from his head. &#x201c;My lucky day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Fargo. While I commend your actions, in the future might I suggest you call the police?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If this happens again, I&#x2019;ll make sure to do that.&#x201d;<br><br>More often than not, he knew Remi would take the proactive approach.<br><br>It was one of the many things he loved about her, he thought, glancing toward the front of the store. She had already given her statement and was waiting patiently by the door.<br><br>A plainclothes investigator, Sergeant Fauth from the Robbery Detail, arrived and was questioning Mr. Pickering, who seemed distracted&#x2014;understandable, considering his age and the circumstances. He opened the still-unlocked safe as the investigator asked, &#x201c;Was anything else taken?&#x201d;<br></i></p><h2>Rescue My Heart (An Animal Magnetism Novel)</h2><p><b>A man and woman with a complicated past find a second chance at romance in this Animal Magnetism novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jill Shalvis.<br><br></b>After a tragic stint in the National Guards, Adam Connelly returns to Idaho and to Belle Haven, the animal shelter he owns with his brothers.

Her baseball-themed romances include<i> Slow Heat </i>and <i>Double Play</i>, and she also appears in anthologies such as<i> He&#x2019;s The One</i>.<b>Chapter 1</b><p></p><p>There was a fine line between being exhausted and being comatose, and Adam Connelly had just about found it. He&#x2019;d been two nights without sleep, half that without food, and his shoulder hurt like hell where his shirt was sticking to his open wound.</p><p>It was hard to feel much past the heart-pounding adrenaline surge still making his limbs quiver, but the pain managed to creep through. The freezing burn of the sleet slapping him in the face didn&#x2019;t help either as he opened his pack and shoved in his gear. Later, he&#x2019;d have to take it all back out again and carefully repair, clean, and repack everything after the unexpected rescue, but for now he wasn&#x2019;t particularly inclined toward much besides getting the hell out of there.</p><p>Milo stood at his side, still in his search and rescue vest, attentive to their surroundings even though he had to be as done in as Adam. Knowing it, Adam forced a few deep breaths to try and slow his heart rate. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; he asked, pretending he wasn&#x2019;t fighting his still knocking knees to hold him up. &#x201c;Food, sleep . . . or a woman?&#x201d;</p><p>Milo nudged the pocket of the daypack where his food was kept.</p><p>Adam shook his head, finding some humor in the day, after all. &#x201c;You always vote for food.&#x201d;</p><p>The ten-month-old yellow lab seemed to smile at that. He was a search-and-rescue dog now, but not too long ago, he&#x2019;d been nothing more than a scrappy, unwanted pup. In Milo&#x2019;s world, food still trumped everything else.</p><p>Adam got that. After all, like tended to recognize like. Besides, sleep was overrated, and it wasn&#x2019;t as if a woman had been on his calendar, anyway. Hell, a woman hadn&#x2019;t been even a glimmer of a possibility in too long to contemplate.</p><p>His own fault. &#x201c;Food it is, then,&#x201d; he said, and realized in spite of still shaking and sweating, he was starving, too. That was a good sign, he decided. It meant that the PTSD had been kicked down to a lowly 3 on the scale, when two years ago it would&#x2019;ve been at a 10.5, not to mention wholly consuming him.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>Besides, he&#x2019;d never been able to resist a good adrenaline rush. After all, some of his fondest memories were born of adrenaline rushes&#x2014;being five years old and running like hell from a pack of Rottweilers that he and his brother Dell had accidentally roused while climbing fences. Or at fourteen, getting caught drinking underage and &#x201c;borrowing&#x201d; a &#x2019;69 classic GTO&#x2014;a joy ride that had landed him in juvie. Hell, for most of his teenage years, fathers everywhere had feared Adam&#x2019;s influence on their impressionable sons and mothers had locked up their daughters on Saturday nights. And then it had all caught up with him in one horrifying tragic evening that had changed the direction of his entire life.</p><p>Good times.</p><p>Footsteps came up behind him; Kel, the local sheriff and good friend. Hooking his radio back on his hip, he squinted through the wind and freezing rain whipping at them, rippling the surface of Bear Lake into a frenzy in front of them. &#x201c;Nice job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a job,&#x201d; Adam reminded him. They&#x2019;d just happened to be scouting out this area for new rugged terrain to be used in search and rescue training. They&#x2019;d been doing a complete two-day run through when they stumbled into a real rescue situation. &#x201c;It was just sheer dumb luck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Good</i> luck,&#x201d; Kel corrected. &#x201c;All those years you spent overseas saving the good guys asses left you like a machine. Man, the way you shimmied down that sheer rock to get to the kid before he slipped . . .&#x201d; Kel shook his head in marvel. &#x201c;And how the hell did you hold on to him like that until I got the ropes to you without popping your shoulder out of the socket? You do that Superman shit in the military, too?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Among other things</i>, Adam thought, but he merely shrugged, a movement that caused the laceration on his shoulder to split further. <i>Some machine</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, however you did it,&#x201d; Kel said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s damn good to have you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, well, there was back, and then there was <i>back</i>. Adam couldn&#x2019;t have gripped a rope right then to save his life. He could no longer hear the thump-thump-thump of the vanishing helicopter airlifting the ten-year-old and his father out of this remote area, which was good. His foster brother, Brady, was behind the chopper&#x2019;s controls, which alleviated any concern about the increasingly bad weather. Brady, an ex&#x2013;army ranger who&#x2019;d retained all of his skills, could fly in and out of the eye of a needle if he had to. From here to Coeur d&#x2019;Alene would be a picnic, oncoming storm or not.</p><p>Kel shouldered his pack. Adam did the same but much more gingerly. Normally, there&#x2019;d be hours of post-rescue takedown, but everything had happened too fast. As the region&#x2019;s coordinator and S&amp;R team leader, Adam hadn&#x2019;t even had time to set up an incident command post or mobilize a search. There weren&#x2019;t the usual myriad trucks or equipment or people it generally took to run an S&amp;R, and for once, that was a good thing.</p><p>They could go home right now, and Adam could stop expending all his energy on appearing to be fine, when what he really wanted to do was pass out and pretend today hadn&#x2019;t happened. Because although he made a living teaching and training search and rescue, and he had more accredited initials after his name than the alphabet was long, he hadn&#x2019;t actually been <i>active</i> in a rescue in two years. Not since Afghanistan, when he and his unit had been called in to rescue a group of British soldiers stuck on the side of a godforsaken mountain. That day they&#x2019;d dropped in from helicopters and rappelled down cliffs and into the caves.</p><p>And straight into enemy fire.</p><p>Most of the time, that memory was buried deep. But today, thirty minutes ago, Adam had faced his nightmares in broad daylight. He&#x2019;d had to rappel down a cliff to save that kid, and being forced into an active role like that, hanging off those rocks at the mouth of the caves, <i>barely</i> grabbing the boy in time&#x2014;it had all brought him back to a very dark place.</p><p>Milo pushed his wet nose into Adam&#x2019;s palm and leaned against him, something the dog wasn&#x2019;t supposed to do on the job. Adam didn&#x2019;t correct him for it, didn&#x2019;t have the heart. There hadn&#x2019;t been much softness in Adam&#x2019;s life, and even less affection, and though he didn&#x2019;t yearn for either, something about the damn dog got to him every time. He looked down at Milo, who was panting happily up at him, his brown eyes clearly saying, <i>Dude, concentrate! Food!</i></p><p>And Adam had to laugh. &#x201c;Right. Food.&#x201d; Always food. And proof that even a dog had better sense than to hang on to the negative shit.</p><p>They all headed back to Adam&#x2019;s Polaris Ranger, a four-wheel, all-terrain vehicle that could get them in and out of just about anywhere&#x2014;at least until the heavy snows came. &#x201c;Up,&#x201d; Adam said to Milo, but the dog leaned on him again. Worried. And Adam realized the dog wasn&#x2019;t fooled by Adam&#x2019;s cool exterior but was picking up on his lingering anxiety. With a sigh, he crouched and hugged the dog. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. You&#x2019;re fine. We&#x2019;re all fine. Now up.&#x201d;</p><p>Milo leapt into the small backseat of the ATV and Adam angled in behind the wheel. With Kel riding rifle, they four-wheeled out of there. By the time Adam dropped Kel off at his station in their small hometown of Sunshine, the adrenaline was definitely wearing off. Pain was a dull ache in his shoulder, right behind his eyes, and in his heart, but he told himself to suck it up because at least this rescue had a happy ending.</p><p>A gust of wind brought in more icy rain, and the first few flakes of snow. Yesterday it had been sixty-five degrees. Today, snow. Welcome to early December at the base of the Bitterroot Mountains in Idaho. By the time he off-roaded to the property he owned with his brothers, the snow kicked up a little bit in intensity, the landscape going soft and white and quiet.</p><p>He loved quiet.</p><p>He pulled into Belle Haven, which spanned thirty acres and was big enough to house their large vet clinic and stable their horses. Having been gone two days, Adam needed to poke his head in the office to pick up his messages and check on things.</p><p>And then sleep.</p><p>With any luck Dell would&#x2019;ve treated all his patients for the day and locked up by now so that Adam wouldn&#x2019;t have to see anyone and talk about what had happened. Unfortunately, he&#x2019;d run out of luck a long time ago. When he pulled into the lot, Dell&#x2019;s truck was still there, next to Adam&#x2019;s in fact, which was freshly washed and shiny clean as always.</p><p>Not Dell&#x2019;s. Dell&#x2019;s was covered in a fine layer of dust and filled with crap. Work equipment, sporting gear, yesterday&#x2019;s fast-food lunch wrappings . . . It boggled Adam&#x2019;s organized mind. But then again, Dell hadn&#x2019;t gone into the military and had the discipline drilled into him. Dell, two years younger than Adam, had gone to vet school, and had gotten used to practically living out of his truck while trying to make it through. Old habits died hard.</p><p>Adam strode into the animal center, with Milo on his heels. Their reception area was large and airy, with wide planked wood floors lined with comfortable benches for waiting. At one end was a long counter, behind which was the hub of the entire place. Jade&#x2019;s arena. Jade was their drill sergeant slash office manager and also Dell&#x2019;s very significant other slash better half.</p><p>At the sight of him, she stood up, a strawberry blond pin-up girl in eye-popping pink, phone in hand. Adam considered himself tough as hell and street smart. Jade was both tougher and smarter than he, and most competent at running his world when he needed her to.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s back,&#x201d; she said into the receiver, no doubt reporting to Dell. Dropping the phone, she came around the counter, eyes on Milo, whom she crouched low to hug. &#x201c;Hi there, handsome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right back atcha, beautiful,&#x201d; Adam said.</p><p>This earned him a smile as Jade slipped Milo a dog cookie.</p><p>Milo snarfed it down and licked his chops, eyeing her hopefully for a second, even though he knew the rules. One cookie at a time.</p><p>A young cat sat on the counter next to the cookie jar. Beans ruled the place with the same fierceness Jade did.</p><p>Milo whined up at her. The pup wanted to be friends so bad he could taste it. But Beans eyed the dog with the same general disdain she held for the rest of the world before lifting a leg to wash her Lady Town with quiet dignity.</p><p>With a sigh for the lost cause, Milo plopped to the floor, head on his front paws, eyes soulful.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Jade said to Adam. &#x201c;You look like hell. You need a cookie, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Need something.&#x201d;</p><p>Her expression softened. &#x201c;I have leftover chicken in the kitchen. I&#x2019;ll make you a plate.&#x201d; She grabbed his messages. &#x201c;The IDRA called. They want to publish your latest article on S&amp;R dog training.&#x201d;</p><p>Adam was a certified instructor and evaluator for the Idaho Dog Rescue Association, both for handlers and dogs, and had provided much of the site&#x2019;s public education content. &#x201c;Tell them that&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, and that reporter from the <i>Coeur d&#x2019;Alene Chronicle</i> called&#x2014;Cynthia Withers. She wants to know if you&#x2019;ll pose in their annual Hot Outdoorsmen calendar this year. She said she asked you last year and you said&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck no.&#x201d;</p><p>Jade grinned. &#x201c;Yeah, that. Shame, though. You could totally make the cover, especially with that two-day scruffy, smoldering glower you&#x2019;ve got going on right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Adam didn&#x2019;t react to this. Reacting only gave Jade ammunition. But he did feel an eye twitch coming on to go with his headache.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn, you&#x2019;re no fun today.&#x201d; Jade tossed that message to the trash and read the next one. &#x201c;Oh, yeah. Tina Molan enjoyed your puppy training class so much that she wants <i>private</i> lessons this time. For herself, not her puppy,&#x201d; Jade clarified, looking like she was thoroughly enjoying herself. &#x201c;She said, and I quote, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a most excellent master, and she&#x2019;s most eager to be . . . <i>mastered</i>.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Yeah. A definite eye twitch. He gave Jade a long look, which didn&#x2019;t bother her in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, don&#x2019;t shoot the messenger,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know damn well that you look like a fallen dark angel. The price for that, you poor, <i>poor</i> baby, is women wanting you. You ought to try dating some of them&#x2014;that would scare them off in no time.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, yeah, message received. But he wasn&#x2019;t big on socializing and hadn&#x2019;t been in a while. Watching half his unit be blown away in a war zone tended to do that to a person, he&#x2019;d been assured. He&#x2019;d get back on the bike soon. Things would get better. Time would heal all his wounds. Blah, blah, blah, he&#x2019;d heard it all. Some of those old adages might actually be true, but most of the time it all felt like a load of bullshit to him.</p><p>Dell stepped out from the back, tailed by Gertie, his one-year-old, happy-go-lucky St. Bernard. &#x201c;You tell him about the calendar offer?&#x201d; Dell asked Jade.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He says he can&#x2019;t wait to pose.&#x201d;</p><p>Adam shook his head at his brother. &#x201c;Your woman thinks she&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m my <i>own</i> woman,&#x201d; Jade said.</p><p>Gertie made a beeline for Adam, his welcome-home committee in a one-hundred-pound package of joy, exuberance and slobber.</p><p>Adam held up a hand. Gertie, eager to obey him, skidded in her efforts to stop. She failed, and ran into Adam&#x2019;s legs, nearly taking him out. Panting, Gertie regrouped and sat obediently, looking up at him in adoration.</p><p>Milo hadn&#x2019;t left his position at Adam&#x2019;s other side, his training too strong to break posture, but he stared at Gertie with the same love that Gertie lavished on Adam.</p><p>With a soft laugh, Adam crouched low and gave Gert a full body rub that had her falling bonelessly to the floor in ecstasy. &#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; he said to Milo, who happily joined the love fest.</p><p>Beans looked unimpressed.</p><p>Dell extracted Adam&#x2019;s messages from Jade, leaning in to nuzzle and then kiss her jaw as he did. She cupped his face and kissed him softly before heading to the back, her heels clicking as she left Dell and Adam alone.</p><p>Or as alone as one could get surrounded by all the animals. Dell eyed his dog flat on her back, trying to entice Adam to rub her down again. &#x201c;She missed you guys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see that.&#x201d; Looking at Dell was a whole lot like looking in the mirror. Same dark hair, dark eyes, and dark skin they&#x2019;d gotten from their Native American mother, who&#x2019;d given them up as young boys to go back to her reservation. Same big, broad build they&#x2019;d gotten from their Texan, all-American football player father, who was long dead. Same matching commitment and authority issues they&#x2019;d gotten from their unstable youth.</p><p>&#x201c;You had a long few days,&#x201d; Dell said casually.</p><p>The equivalent of a welcome-back hug. Adam shrugged and then sucked in a pained breath as the movement jarred his shoulder. He concentrated on the fresh warm blood that trickled down his back instead of his brother&#x2019;s intense gaze.</p><p>Kel might have been a little clueless on exactly how long it had been since Adam had been on the active side of an S&amp;R mission instead of running it, but Dell was not.</p><p>&#x201c;So you saved the kid,&#x201d; Dell said.</p><p>&#x201c;Milo found him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clinging to the cliff that you then had to climb because no one else was close enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Adam blew out a sigh. &#x201c;Brady called you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Brady called,&#x201d; Dell confirmed...</p></p><h2>NKJV Amplified Parallel Bible (Hardcover): Large Print Edition</h2><p><p><b><i>Complementary translations encourage in-depth study of the Scriptures</i> </b></p><p>Bible study leaders, Scripture students, preachers, and people curious to see their favorite biblical texts in different translations will benefit from this volume.

And what you&#x2019;re up against is bad bacteria. As gross as it sounds, bacteria inhabit just about every part of your body, gut included. The tiny ecosystem in our bellies known as the gut microbiota contains tens of trillions of microorganisms. One third of your gut microbiota is common to most humans. Two thirds is specific to you, as unique as your fingerprint.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this wide variety of gut bugs coexists peacefully, promoting proper digestive function, strong immunity, and overall vitality. But too many of the wrong bacteria, or not enough of the good ones, can have negative effects. This imbalance between the beneficial and harmful bacteria in the gut is known as <i>dysbiosis</i>&#x2014;�the opposite of symbiosis, which describes coexistence in a state of harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dysbiosis can make you feel nauseated, cause belly pain or bloating, or make you gassy (very gassy). Bowel movements change&#x2014;�you might have to &#x201c;go&#x201d; too much (diarrhea) or too little (constipation). You may also feel extremely tired; experience chronic pain from inflamed, aching joints; or feel mentally foggy. Sounds like fun, right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second characteristic of a healthy gut is a no-�leak intestinal lining, the immune system&#x2019;s first line of defense. This lining looks like a net with very fine mesh. In a healthy gut, the holes are so tiny that only certain substances can pass through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if the lining is damaged, the holes get bigger. All sorts of undesirables&#x2014;�bacteria, viruses, yeast, undigested food particles&#x2014;�literally leak out of your small intestine into your bloodstream. The condition&#x2019;s formal name is &#x201c;increased intestinal permeability,&#x201d; but it is more commonly known as leaky gut. Leaky gut can also lead to low-�grade, body-�wide inflammation and digestive issues, skin problems like psoriasis, and autoimmune diseases. People with leaky guts may also develop food sensitivities, because partially digested particles of protein and fat leaking through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream causes an allergic response. They may also be less able to absorb nutrients. And they may gain weight. With a leaky gut, the symptoms are all over the map. Digestive symptoms such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea may make life miserable. Your skin may break out in acne or other rashes. Your mood might change, and you may feel either depressed or anxious. You might develop seasonal allergies or even asthma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve treated thousands of people with leaky guts. Before they come through my door, they&#x2019;ve seen doctor after doctor, taken test after test, and their symptoms are still a mystery, both to them and to the specialists they see. Tellingly, most Western-�trained doctors don&#x2019;t believe leaky gut exists. It&#x2019;s practitioners who embrace alternative medicine systems who typically diagnose and treat it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here, let me touch briefly on the &#x201c;second brain,&#x201d; housed in your gut. Called the enteric nervous system, the gut-�brain is wired to the head-�brain, and they&#x2019;re in constant communication. When all is well, the messages are quick updates. But if the gut is unhappy, it lets the brain know. A constant onslaught of negative messages from the gut can affect the nerve activity in the brain, leading to disturbances in mood and sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But biology is only part of the 21-Day Belly Fix. The principles of Chinese medicine and Ayurveda are also very important to activating its full weight-�loss potential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>YOUR DIGESTIVE FIRE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In your mind&#x2019;s eye, picture a roaring campfire. See the tongues of flame leap skyward. Feel the warmth of the flames on your face, in your bones. Hear the snap, crackle, and pop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, imagine that campfire at dawn. The air is chill and damp. The fire is out, or nearly so. No light, no heat. Only scraps of charred wood, a thin wisp of smoke twisting in the air.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A fire burning up whatever is thrown into it, efficiently (good!) versus a pile of cold embers that lets whatever is tossed on top sit and rot (bad!). Those images suggest the two primary states of the digestive system in two ancient systems of healing, Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is digestive fire? Each system approaches it from a slightly different angle. Chinese medicine (see page 8) focuses on diet. The stomach, it says, is a cooking pot; the spleen, which rules digestion, is the fire underneath the pot. Warmed by the spleen, the stomach cooks and breaks down what we eat. Eat well, and you&#x2019;ll feel well, because the food directly makes up our <i>qi</i>&#x2014;�our natural energy, a measure of our health and vitality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ayurveda, which originated in India almost three thousand years ago (see page 6), teaches that within each of us is a digestive fire that converts food to energy, and it&#x2019;s either in full blaze or a smoking pile of embers. A hot, bright blaze is the source of health, strength, nourishment, and energy. Yay! You must be eating a balanced diet. A smoky, smoldering fire weakens vitality, setting the stage for disease. Yikes. How many Dove Bars did you eat?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That rain-�dampened campfire is the perfect way to picture chronic, low-�grade inflammation in the body. Inflammation isn&#x2019;t always bad. It&#x2019;s part of the body&#x2019;s immune response, a natural reaction to injury and outside invaders. But there are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acute kind of inflammation is a protective response to irritation, trauma, or infection. Say you get a splinter in your finger. The injured tissue sends out signals to open blood vessels and allow fluids to move from the vessels to the injured tissue. The fluid carries blood cells and other substances that help fight infection and begin the repair process. The familiar signs of inflammation&#x2014;�redness, swelling, and pain&#x2014;�are caused by the increase in fluid around the injured area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chronic inflammation is another story. It&#x2019;s the damaging immune response caused by a variety of invaders including chemical toxins, food particles your gut can&#x2019;t digest, and even too much body fat. Like that rain-�dampened campfire, chronic inflammation smokes and smolders continually. And over time, it wears down your immune system, paving the way for disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you already know that studies link chronic inflammation to cancer and cardiovascular disease. What you may not know is that it may play a role in Alzheimer&#x2019;s, celiac disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x2019;s disease, the two most common types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the debilitating autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, and even obesity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both gut dysbiosis and a leaky gut trigger inflammation. Fortunately, the simple diet and lifestyle changes in the 21-Day Belly Fix help rebalance gut bacteria and seal a leaky intestinal lining, promoting good digestive health and quenching that smoldering, vitality-�sapping inflammation. You can see how combining Western medicine with ancient medicine can benefit you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Agni and Ama</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Ayurveda, the three doshas of vata, pitta, and kapha help form our unique constitutions, and they have a specific impact on bodily functions. Doshas are determined through medical history, exams, face readings, tongue and pulse readings, and personality assessments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the doshas impact digestion, each in its unique way. That digestive fire I spoke of earlier? In Ayurveda, it&#x2019;s called <i>agni.</i> It&#x2019;s responsible for absorbing the nutrients the body needs while burning off waste products. When agni is strong, your metabolism hums, your body systems (digestive and others) work well individually and together, and you feel physically and mentally well, strong, and calm. A weak agni means an unbalanced body and mind. You feel sluggish, your mood takes a nosedive, your systems begin to malfunction, your skin and hair grow dull, and your metabolism slows considerably, leading to weight gain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A weak agni is caused by a buildup of <i>ama</i>&#x2014;�undigested food that forms a toxic sludge within your digestive system. Ama is thought to lead to disease over time. I find it notable that a healthy mix of gut bacteria corresponds to agni, while a strong gut lining is one benefit of reducing ama.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Signs of ama include bad breath, a coated tongue, constipation, fatigue, and depression. (In Ayurveda, the inability to &#x201c;digest&#x201d; emotions&#x2014;�anger, sadness, guilt&#x2014;�can produce just as much ama as undigested food. Think of it as emotional sludge&#x2014;�toxic emotions that you can&#x2019;t eliminate.) To correct ama, Ayurveda recommends an individualized system that incorporates diet, herbal remedies, lifestyle modifications, and purification of digestion through fasting or detoxification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese-�medicine version of ama is known as &#x201c;dampness&#x201d; or &#x201c;excessive phlegm.&#x201d; In these states, undigested food creates a sticky pudding-�like mass in the body that causes &#x201c;stagnation.&#x201d; In the language of mainstream medicine, stagnation is the inability of nutrients and blood to help other organ systems. Stagnation leads to &#x201c;cold,&#x201d; which creates joint pain, constipation, hormone changes, and changes in mental health. Curing disease starts with correcting dampness or excess phlegm. The healing tools include herbs that relieve dampness, diet changes to reverse cold, and acupuncture to improve stagnation. All of these treatments strive to improve qi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love that these two ancient systems of medicine share the same goal: vibrant health, rather than symptom or disease management. It&#x2019;s a positive goal and a departure from the Western model of medicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combining all the models is what makes the 21-Day Belly Fix work. The practice of integrative medicine is both art and science. This means that I rely on the diagnostic tools of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, based primarily on physical examination. But I confirm those diagnoses with conventional medical tests and add the latest breakthroughs in nutritional science to ancient healing diets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, as ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic healers did, I view each patient as unique&#x2014;�a fusion of inborn traits and external choices and habits that, together, affect their health. These unique qualities suggest the appropriate treatments. In some patients, symptoms of a dosha imbalance are very apparent. In others, it&#x2019;s the symptoms of blocked qi, dampness, or heat that leap out at me. Sometimes, I use acupuncture, acupressure, or Chinese herbs to return the body to balance. And sometimes, it&#x2019;s the healing foods of Ayurveda (kitchari, ghee, ginger) or the Ayurvedic practices of yoga and abdominal massage that bring relief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You, too, are unique. The strength of the 21-Day Belly Fix program is that it&#x2019;s designed around treatments that are healing for the majority of my patients. Used in combination, each treatment&#x2014;�diet, herbs, supplements, exercise, stress management&#x2014;�is far more powerful than it is in isolation. Together, they return the body to balance, and balance is the 21-Day Belly Fix&#x2019;s overriding goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The key to a 21-Day Belly Fix success is identifying your unique food story, understanding your dosha and your Chinese meridian diagnosis, rebuilding your gut bacteria, and identifying your core gut issues. In our practice, we use Chinese medicine pulse and tongue readings, meridian analysis, Ayurvedic pulse readings, and conventional patient histories and physical exams, along with measuring pH and running blood tests to help nail the diagnosis. In this book, you benefit from the combined wisdom of thousands of patients seen in my practice and successfully treated using this approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How Badly Do You Need a 21-Day Belly Fix?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on core principles of nutrition, Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and Western medicine, this simple yes-�or-�no quiz can help you gauge your level of ama. Circle the response that best describes you, awarding yourself one point for every yes answer and zero points for a no response. The more yeses you have, the higher the likelihood that you&#x2019;re in the �gutter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Face</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, your face reveals your health. Ama, dampness, and stagnation show up on your face&#x2014;�and often, cosmetics can&#x2019;t hide them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.You have dark circles under your eyes. y </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.You have rashes that are red and irritated (includes acne, eczema, rosacea, or any red irritation). y </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.Your face is puffy or swollen. y </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.Your tongue has a white or yellow coating. y </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.Your skin color is/has been described as pale or dull. y </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Energy Level</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you often fatigued and mentally foggy? Do you joke about &#x201c;carb comas&#x201d;? The health of your gut and the health of your diet can dramatically affect your energy levels. If you&#x2019;ve ever done a detoxification diet, you know that it makes your energy skyrocket.

Why is joy so resistant to language? How has it become so suspect in our times? Manipulated by advertisers, religious leaders, and politicians, joy can seem disquieting, even offensive. How does one speak of joy amid such ubiquitous injustice and suffering in the world?<br><br> In this revelatory anthology, Wiman takes readers on a profound and surprising journey through some of the most underexplored terrain in contemporary life. Rather than define joy for readers, he wants them to experience it. Ranging from Emily Dickinson to Mahmoud Darwish and from Sylvia Plath to Wendell Berry, he brings together diverse and provocative works as a kind of counter to the old, modernist maxim &#x201c;light writes white&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>no agony, no art</i>. His rich selections awaken us to the essential role joy plays in human life.</p><p><b>Christian Wiman</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer</i>.

Even the most familiar poets seem somehow new within the context of&nbsp;Joy.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Skeel, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>&#x201c;Christian Wiman takes readers through the ostensible ordinariness of life and reveals the extraordinary.&#x201d;&#x2014;Adrianna Smith, <i>The Atlantic</i><br>"Amid the darkness of this season &#x2014; nay, this moment in history &#x2014; this book of poems is certainly prescriptive, the antidote to deepening psychic ails. . . . Wiman&#x2019;s own history of mortal sufferings. . . makes him a sharp-eyed explorer, on vigilant watch for those shimmering shards of joy along the circuitous climb. . . . In an introduction worthy of memorization, Wiman writes: '<i>Joy </i>is the only inoculation against the despair to which any sane person is prone.'"&#x2014;Barbara Mahany, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (featured in Chicago Tribune's holiday roundup)<br>"Since the Christmas season is a time for joyful contemplation, it would be particularly fitting to linger with the poems in <i>Joy: 100 Poems</i>.

Which it is, of course."&#x2014;<i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br>Ragle Gumm has a unique job: every day he wins a newspaper contest. And when he isn&#x2019;t consulting his charts and tables, he enjoys his life in a small town in 1959. At least, that&#x2019;s what he thinks. But then strange things start happening. He finds a phone book where all the numbers have been disconnected, and a magazine article about a famous starlet he&#x2019;s never heard of named Marilyn Monroe. Plus, everyday objects are beginning to disappear and are replaced by strips of paper with words written on them like "bowl of flowers" and "soft drink stand." When Ragle skips town to try to find the cause of these bizarre occurrences, his discovery could make him question everything he has ever known.<br><br></p><p><b>Time Out of Joint</b> is Philip K. Dick?s classic depiction of the disorienting disparity between the world as we think it is and the world as it actually is. The year is 1998, although Ragle Gumm doesn?t know that. He thinks it?s 1959. He also thinks that he served in World War II, that he lives in a quiet little community, and that he really is the world?s long-standing champion of newspaper puzzle contests. It is only after a series of troubling hallucinations that he begins to suspect otherwise. And once he pursues his suspicions, he begins to see how he is the center of a universe gone terribly awry.<p>Over a writing career that spanned three decades, PHILIP K. DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned toward deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film,&nbsp;notably&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall,</i><i>Minority Report,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly. </i>The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the&nbsp;Science Fiction&nbsp;Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes. His work has been translated into&nbsp;more than twenty-five&nbsp;languages.</p></p><h2>The Indian World of George Washington: The First President, the First Americans, and the Birth of the Nation</h2><p>George Washington's place in the foundations of the Republic remains unrivalled. His life story--from his beginnings as a surveyor and farmer, to colonial soldier in the Virginia Regiment, leader of the Patriot cause, commander of the Continental Army, and finally first president of the United States--reflects the narrative of the nation he guided into existence. There is, rightfully, no more chronicled figure.<br><br>Yet American history has largely forgotten what Washington himself knew clearly: that the new Republic's fate depended less on grand rhetoric of independence and self-governance and more on land--Indian land. Colin G. Calloway's biography of the greatest founding father reveals in full the relationship between Washington and the Native leaders he dealt with intimately across the decades: Shingas, Tanaghrisson, Guyasuta, Attakullakulla, Bloody Fellow, Joseph Brant, Cornplanter, Red Jacket, and Little Turtle, among many others. Using the prism of Washington's life to bring focus to these figures and the tribes they represented--the Iroquois Confederacy, Lenape, Miami, Creek, Delaware--Calloway reveals how central their role truly was in Washington's, and therefore the nation's, foundational narrative.<br><br>Calloway gives the First Americans their due, revealing the full extent and complexity of the relationships between the man who rose to become the nation's most powerful figure and those whose power and dominion declined in almost equal degree during his lifetime. His book invites us to look at America's origins in a new light. <em>The Indian World of George Washington </em>is a brilliant portrait of both the most revered man in American history and those whose story during the tumultuous century in which the country was formed has, until now, been only partially told.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin G. Calloway</strong> is John Kimball Jr. 1943 Professor of History and Native American Studies at Dartmouth College. His previous books include <em>A Scratch of the Pen </em>and <em>The Victory with No Name</em>.<br><br>"In addition to his lively prose, Calloway includes a number of excellent maps, as well as a helpful list of important Native Americans, often with their English and transliterated native names. This book should prove valuable to scholars and interesting to a general audience" -- Robert M. Owens, <em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Colin Calloway demonstrates how profoundly George Washington's life was interwoven with the Indian world of North America. This book will forever change our understanding of the first president and the very meaning of the new nation he helped to create."--David Preston, author of <em>Braddock's</em> <em>Defeat</em><p></p><br>"Calloway has written an important and original interpretation of critical years in the formation of federal policies toward the claims and rights of Native Americans." -- Booklist <br><p></p><br>"An expansive history...a detailed, impressively researched history of white-Indian relations during Washington's lifetime. Insightful and illuminating." -- Kirkus Reviews <br><p></p><br>"In <em>The Indian World of George Washington</em>, Colin Calloway thoughtfully and lucidly recovers a lost time, when Indian peoples' diplomacy and resistance helped to shape the new United States. No American President had a greater impact on natives or was more affected by his interactions with them." -- Alan Taylor, author of <em>American Revolutions: A Continental History, 1750-1804</em> <br><p></p><br>"Finally, one of the best historians of colonial native America has taken up the challenge of putting one of the most important pieces of George Washington's life and experience back into the narrative. Calloway's monumental analysis helps us understand a half century of powerful and impactful native American history more clearly, and gives a fresh take on Washington's own challenges, frustrations, and successes-which together helped shape the destiny of American Republic." -- Douglas Bradburn, President and CEO of George Washington's Mount Vernon <br><p></p><br>" <em>The Indian World of George Washington</em> describes a critical moment in American history with the beginning of the collapse of what Richard White calls 'The Middle Ground' between white settlers and Indians. Elegantly and engagingly written, Calloway makes a major case for the centrality of Indians in George Washington's America." -- Dr. Andrew J. O'Shaughnessy, Vice President of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (Monticello) and author of <em>The Men Who Lost America</em> <br><p></p><br>"From callow frontier fighter to venerated Founding Father of the United States, George Washington was intimately acquainted with 'Indian Country,' lured by its seemingly boundless potential for personal wealth and national expansion. But as Colin Calloway demonstrates in this ground-breaking study, Washington's vision for the West was contested by powerful tribes and charismatic Native leaders who prized independence as highly as he did. Bolstered by outstanding research, deep knowledge, and keen insight, Calloway's new book offers a sophisticated and original study of a cultural confrontation that was fundamental both for the shaping of Washington's character, and for America's destiny." -- Stephen Brumwell, author of <em>George Washington: Gentleman Warrior</em> <br><p></p><br>"Essential reading in Native American studies, as well as for those seeking a deeper understanding of George Washington and the Native populations of the early republic." -- Library Journal <br><p></p><br>"The fateful relationship between George Washington and the Indian tribes that bordered the new Republic is the subject of Colin Calloway's brilliantly presented and refreshingly original <em>The Indian World of George Washington</em>. . . . An essential new entry in the literature of George Washington and the early Republic." -- Wall Street Journal <br> <br><p></p><br>"Provocative and deeply researched." - The Daily Beast<p></p><br>"Calloway's depth of research, incorporation of the latest scholarship, and analytical talents provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the diplomatic, military, and social interactions that underlay the president's policies." --<em>Michigan History Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>100 Hikes / Travel Guide: Central Oregon Cascades</h2><p>The most comprehensive, reliable guide to the trails of Oregon&#39;s recreational heartland now includes hot springs, museums, brewpubs, fire lookout rentals, wildflowers, campgrounds, parks, and other travel tips for Bend, Sisters, Sunriver, Eugene, and Salem.

To change something, build a new model that makes the beginning model obsolete.&#x201d;</i> <br> Buckminster Fuller<br><br><i>"I am very impressed with your model, and its potential to change people's lives, including my own. I think you are really onto something a radical paradigm shift, but at the same time something so simple and elegant and 'intuitive.' Love yourself and your body it will not only allow you a chance to take care of yourself and find genuine love and happiness, it will give you a chance to see and develop it in others. Peace, love, and happiness what else do you need?" </i><br> Brad Buchman, MD, college health physician<br>At its core, the Be Body Positive Model teaches you to become the expert the authority of your own body by first recognizing, and then trusting, its innate wisdom. Sue Monk Kidd offers my favorite definition of the word <i>authority</i> from the Greek language in her book <i>The Dance of the Dissident Daughter:</i> to stand forth with power and dignity.&#x201d; Elizabeth and I believe this: we all have the right to live with dignity; we possess the power to make good decisions about our unique bodies when we learn to listen closely to the information they provide in every moment. We understand that choosing this path is much easier with support, which is why we have dedicated our lives to helping people reconnect with their inborn ability to identify and pursue what they need in order to thrive.<br><br>The Be Body Positive Model does not offer a step-by-step plan to follow from Point A (body dissatisfaction, dieting, obsession with weight and image) to Point B (self-love, intuitive self-care, freedom from obsession). The work does not resemble typical diet, health, fitness, or other self-improvement programs that instruct clients to follow certain steps to the letter in order to arrive at a promised definition of success; where if they fail it&#x2019;s considered their fault, not the failing of rules that are generally impossible to stick to over the long term, even if they are offered with the best of intentions.<br><br>Elizabeth and I have created a framework for true success because we define it not as a static end goal of perfection, but as a way of living that gives you permission to love, care for, and take pleasure in your body throughout your lifespan. No doubt struggles will occur, especially during times of transition or imbalance. Using the Be Body Positive competencies, however, allows you to find what you need to live with as much self-love and balanced self-care as possible. What you discover will be unique to you and your particular life circumstances. Each experience of discomfort will teach you those things you are required to learn to further your growth. One person can recover from body hatred by spending time working with plants. Someone else will need therapy. Another may need to change careers. Someone may have an easier time transitioning their gender because they are grounded in a deeper, more fundamental self-love. Making changes even big ones can be less complex when you incorporate the aspects of our philosophy that speak to you into your daily life.<br><br>Our model is complete; the five core competencies address all of the obstacles to healing that Elizabeth and I unearthed during decades of preventing and treating eating and body image problems. Many other programs offer a piece of what is useful, but aren&#x2019;t comprehensive enough to help someone deal with the pitfalls that can derail healing. For example, one program might encourage the rejection of media messages that lead to poor self-image, but doesn&#x2019;t provide support to resist the mean comments and aggression directed at many people&#x2019;s bodies from family, friends, and cruel strangers. Another might promote self-compassion, but doesn&#x2019;t speak to the debilitating struggles associated with the pursuit of ideal&#x201d; beauty or health that prevent people from truly loving themselves. Focusing on one (or even a few) of the issues related to improving physical and emotional health can be insufficient in supporting positive, lasting changes in a person&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Elizabeth uses our philosophy and specific activities in her private therapy practice. In so doing, she has tested our model with the most difficult population of all people suffering with diagnosed eating disorders. She has discovered the biggest hurdles people face when working to make peace with their bodies, eating, and exercise. We have fine-tuned and improved the model by creating a solution to each one of these challenges. Elizabeth&#x2019;s clients, even those who start working with her after struggling with eating disorders and severe self-loathing for years, get better quickly when they are introduced to the Be Body Positive Model. We offer a path to freedom wherever a person may currently be along the spectrum that ranges from slight dissatisfaction with one&#x2019;s body (or garden variety body hatred&#x201d; as one of our youth leaders named it), to active weight loss behaviors, to eating and exercise problems that require clinical help for recovery. The work not only enhances people&#x2019;s physical self-care, but has also been shown to improve self-esteem as well as reduce anxiety and depression.<br><br>I see the five competencies as creating the boundaries of a safe container in which we can explore the inevitable conflicts that arise because we are human beings. They provide a structure free from judgment and blame that allows each of us in our own individual way and time to celebrate our physical bodies and (re)discover the beauty and self-love that are our birthright.<br><b>Kelle J</b> <br><i>When I first came to The Body Positive, my emotional self was buried beneath hardened layers of suffocating shame. When I wasn&#x2019;t emotionally numb, I was overwhelmed by shame and grief. I had been in and out of therapy, recovery programs, and support groups looking for a way out of my self-loathing. Something in me wanted freedom, but each time I began to thaw, the emotional pain became too much to bear, and I made a run for the door. It felt impossible to follow the positive, constructive steps that the therapist or program prescribed, reconfirming my deeply held belief that I was so damaged that there was no possibility of redemption.<br><br>The Be Body Positive Model and community were different. When I first heard Connie and Elizabeth talk about self-love, I rejected the notion for myself out-of-hand; I had embodied my shame for so long that I hardly had a self at all, let alone one that I could love. I had a core belief that I did not belong in the world, which made me feel unique in my conviction that I was inherently flawed, damaged, and defective: self-love is possible for you, but not for me.<br><br>However, what I also heard at The Body Positive was that there was no possibility of failure here; that the Be Body Positive Model was not just another set of rules I would surely fail to follow. Instead, I was invited to engage in a process of trial and error where the errors&#x201d; were met with gentleness and represented learning opportunities they were not evidence of my weak and defective nature. Most importantly, I didn&#x2019;t have to get self-love right to belong in this community. What a gift this is! I am still chipping away at the geological layers of shame and self-loathing that sometimes weigh me down, but have been held with love in The Body Positive community long enough to witness the journey to self-love in others, and think to myself, That could be me one day.&#x201d; </i><br><b>Using the Be Body Positive Model in Your Own Life</b><br> <i> To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.&#x201d; </i><br> Henri Bergson, French philosopher (1859-1941)<br><br>The Be Body Positive Model shifts the focus from using harmful, ineffective weight-loss efforts to a practice of improving and maintaining self-care behaviors that are motivated by positive rather than punishing forces. As you practice the competencies, you cultivate the art of forgiveness for making mistakes&#x201d; with food, exercise, and other life choices, and allow yourself to learn and grow from your daily experiences. Over time you relax into the trial and error process of learning to eat and move and live intuitively. As your definition of beauty expands, you have the extraordinary opportunity to see beauty everywhere starting with yourself. You may find that friendships develop with individuals who choose to appreciate their own bodies, and enter into (or stay in) relationships with people who love and respect your body, just as it is in the moment. When the inevitable burdens that come with being human start to weigh you down, you have your Body Positive community for support, or employ humor and self-love to lighten the load when you are alone.<br><br>It takes practice and conscious awareness to experience life through a Body Positive lens. After awhile, however, you&#x2019;ll realize you&#x2019;ve fully embodied the competencies, and it feels natural to love yourself and care for your body from a place of trust. <i>You will become the ultimate authority of your body and your life.</i> As you develop a highly attuned relationship with your body, you will begin to move towards experiences and people in all areas that feel healthy on an intrinsic level. As one person said about her work with The Body Positive, It&#x2019;s a process to take this all in, but once you do, it just becomes part of your everyday life. It&#x2019;s addictive!&#x201d; The addiction she speaks of is the commitment to self-love, the ability to see great beauty in oneself as well as in others, and the pursuit of positive, joyful self-care. What could be better?<br><br> There are numerous reasons why you chose to pick up this book. It is possible your struggle is that you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable with your weight; you are fighting the inevitable process of aging, listening to the messages telling you older people are not beautiful; your height and/or shape cause you to feel you&#x2019;re not attractive; you like certain body parts but others get negative attention from your inner critic. You may be completely fine with your body but can&#x2019;t find love for your human self. Or, you might just be tired of being surrounded by people who are critical of themselves and others, and you&#x2019;re searching for ways to create a community of people who relate in an unusual way by supporting one another in cultivating self-love and pursuing passions other than a perfect physical image. It is for all of these reasons that Elizabeth and I created the Be Body Positive Model, an intuitive approach to health and wellbeing that:<br><br> Defines physical health with real measurements of health rather than arbitrary numbers<br> Restores trust in our own bodies and in our ability to care for them well<br> Gives us permission to deeply and truly love our human selves<br> Expands our definition of beauty to include ourselves and all people<br> Offers a new way to relate to one another, one that does not include self-deprecating comments about our own bodies or comparison with, and judgment of, other people&#x2019;s bodies<br><br>The competencies are offered in a particular order because Elizabeth and I see them as building upon one another. As you integrate them into your daily life, however, you will see that each is part of a whole process and the order becomes irrelevant. You become able to address whatever particular issue arises in the moment with the skills you&#x2019;ve gained.<br><br>Please remember, the Be Body Positive Model does not offer quick fix that will lead you to a prescribed end goal. As with all things worth their weight,&#x201d; changing your relationship with your body can be messy and painful at times. It takes practice. But Elizabeth and I believe this journey is worth every ounce of energy you invest, because it will lead you to a place where you are free to live without restriction; where your fears and internal critics lessen in intensity because your voice of kindness and compassion grows in strength each day. It becomes easier to fully express your thoughts and feelings because your practice of self-love protects you from taking in judgment or releasing it quickly when it does get under your skin. Beauty surrounds you in abundance and life becomes a richer, more meaningful experience.<br><br><i> Embodying the Be Body Positive Model&#x2019;s core competencies is simple and it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s choosing love as often as we can. It&#x2019;s finding humor when we look at the imagery society offers up as beauty. It&#x2019;s listening closely to our bodies and doing our best to follow their wisdom. It&#x2019;s forgiving ourselves when we make mistakes.&#x2019; Ultimately, it&#x2019;s honoring our bodies in all their varied forms as precious and worthy of love and respect.&#x201d;</i><br> Lisa E, Body Positive workshop participant<br></p><h2>Discipline that Restores: Strategies to Create Respect, Cooperation, and Responsibility in the Classroom</h2><p>No education library should be without Discipline That Restores: Strategies to Create Respect, Cooperation, and Responsibility in the Classroom, a monumental effort to articulate a reproducible step-by-step process to increase cooperation and mutual respect in schools by coauthors Ron and Roxanne Claassen.

He says that you should know that you are born with an outer form and an inner essence and it is that inner essence or the spiritual heart that you hve to come to know in order to know who you are.</p><p>Al-Ghaz�l� (c.1056 1111) was one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, and mystics of Sunni Islam. He was active at a time when Sunni theology had just passed through its consolidation and entered a period of intense challenges from Shiite Ism� �lite theology and the Arabic tradition of Aristotelian philosophy (<i>falsafa</i>). Al-Ghaz�l� understood the importance of <i>falsafa</i> and developed a complex response that rejected and condemned some of its teachings, while it also allowed him to accept and apply others. Al-Ghaz�l�'s critique of twenty positions of <i>falsafa</i> in his <i>Incoherence of the Philosophers</i> (<i>Tah�fut al-fal�sifa</i>) is a significant landmark in the history of philosophy as it advances the nominalist critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th century Europe. On the Arabic and Muslim side al-Ghaz�l�'s acceptance of demonstration (<i>apodeixis</i>) led to a much more refined and precise discourse on epistemology and a flowering of Aristotelian logics and metaphysics. With al-Ghaz�l� begins the successful introduction of Aristotelianism or rather Avicennism into Muslim theology. After a period of appropriation of the Greek sciences in the translation movement from Greek into Arabic and the writings of the <i>fal�sifa</i> up to Avicenna (Ibn S�n�, c.980 1037), philosophy and the Greek sciences were naturalized into the discourse of <i>kal�m</i> and Muslim theology (Sabra 1987). Al-Ghaz�l�'s approach to resolving apparent contradictions between reason and revelation was accepted by almost all later Muslim theologians and had, via the works of Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126 98) and Jewish authors a significant influence on Latin medieval thinking. <br>-- Griffel, Frank, "Al-Ghazali", <i>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</p><h2>John S. Sargent: 194 Master Drawings</h2><p>John Singer Sargent was an American leading portrait painter of Edwardian era luxury. During his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings. His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida. In 1907, at the age of fifty-one, Sargent officially closed his studio and focused on landscapes in his later years. After 1917, most critics began to consign him to the masters of the past, &#34;a brilliant ambassador between his patrons and posterity.&#34; Modernists treated him more harshly, considering him completely out of touch with the reality of American life and with emerging artistic trends including Cubism and Futurism. Sargent quietly accepted the criticism, but refused to alter his negative opinions of modern art. He retorted, &#34;Ingres, Raphael and El Greco, these are now my admiration, these are what I like.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Spirited: Unlock Your Psychic Self and Change Your Life</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Secret</em> meets <em>Skinny Bitch</em> in <em>Spirited</em>, the fresh, hip book by popular psychic medium Rebecca Rosen. </strong></p><p>A prescriptive program that has worked for celebrity clients including Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox Arquette, <em>Spirited</em> empowers readers to heighten their intuition, connect with deceased loved ones, and surpass the psychological roadblocks holding them back.

Illuminated here for the first time in picture book form is the true story of a thrilling night when they made history together! <br><br> On a brisk and cloudless evening in April 1933, Amelia and Eleanor did the unprecedented: They stole away from a White House dinner, commandeered an Eastern Air Transport jet, and took off on a glorious adventure--while still dressed in their glamorous evening gowns! <br><br> This picture book tour de force celebrates the pioneering spirit of two friends whose passion for life gave them the courage to defy convention in the name of fulfillment, conviction, and fun. Soaring text, inspired by the known facts of this event, and breathtaking drawings ask readers to dream dreams as big as Amelia and Eleanor's.</p><p>On a clear April evening in 1933, two outspoken and strong-minded friends slipped away from a formal dinner party to have a little unconventional fun. What made this event remarkable was that the two were Amelia Earhart and Eleanor Roosevelt, dining at the White House; their entertainment of choice was to fly an airplane on a loop from Washington D.C. to Baltimore. Pooh-poohing Secret Service agents' concerns that this activity hadn't been "approved," the celebrated aviator and the First Lady stole away before dessert was served, and took to the sky.<p> Inspired by the true facts of this little-known event, based on diaries, book transcripts, and newspaper accounts, Pam Munoz Ryan brings the thrilling evening to life as if she had been on that plane herself. Emphasizing the mettle and independent spirits of the two women, Ryan presents a pair of pioneering social and political activists any woman--or man--even today would be proud to claim as role models.

What can they afford to order from the menu? Join the fun and pig out on math and money concepts with the Pigs!</p><p>Grade 1-3-In this bright and bouncy concept book, the Pigs turn their house upside down looking for spare change so that they can go out to dinner. Readers are invited to count along as the porkers dig out cash from the socks drawer, pennies from under the bed, quarters from the closet, and a five-dollar bill from the washing machine. Answers are hidden in the illustrations. The Pigs' reward is a trip to the Enchanted Enchilada. The whole menu is reproduced, complete with prices, so readers can figure out what the family can afford to eat and how much money they will have left over. A final page recaps all the amounts and shows the multiplication and addition necessary to find the answers. The vibrant illustrations are done in yellow, turquoise, pink, orange, and green. Those hues, along with the cacti in the yard and the Mexican restaurant, give the book a Southwestern flair. The Pigs are wildly dressed, from the daughter's fishnet stockings to the father's floppy black-and-white bow tie. After they have heard the story once, children will enjoy going back and studying the pictures. An entertaining tool for reinforcing math skills that should be especially useful in a whole-language curriculum.<br><i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Few picture books illustrate the "capitalist pig" concept as graphically as this mathematics-based volume does with its glorification of greed and gluttony. After gobbling up all the groceries, Mr. Pig, Mrs. Pig and their two piglets are hungry again, but the Piggy bank is empty. Deciding to hunt for money, the four swine gesture excitedly; then they feverishly root through their home for loose change and bills. Readers are meant to keep a tally of the dimes and nickels the Pigs locate, but they may be misled by the monetary sums planted in the illustrations (on one spread, the text describes a find worth $2.67, but the figures $2.32, $4.22 and $2.81 appear in the art; these numbers, we learn at the end, are part of a suggested math problem). Finally, after finding a grand total of $34.67, the Pigs spend almost all of it at a Mexican restaurant--math whizzes can calculate the tab by reading a menu. Although Axelrod's debut undoubtedly encourages useful skills, it is singularly unappetizing, while McGinley-Nally's ( First Snow, Magic Snow ) pudgy, stylized pigs and Southwestern motif seem garish. Kids probably won't have the patience for this book, and parents won't have the stomach.

S. Lewis In <em>From Achilles to Christ,</em> Louis Markos introduces readers to the great narratives of classical mythology from a Christian perspective. From the battles of Achilles and the adventures of Odysseus to the feats of Hercules and the trials of Aeneas, Markos shows how the characters, themes and symbols within these myths both foreshadow and find their fulfillment in the story of Jesus Christ--the "myth made fact." Along the way, he dispels misplaced fears about the dangers of reading classical literature, and offers a Christian approach to the interpretation and appropriation of these great literary works. This engaging and eminently readable book is an excellent resource for Christian students, teachers and readers of classical literature.</p><p><strong>Louis Markos</strong> (Ph.D., University of Michigan) is professor of English at Houston Baptist University, where he teaches classical and English literature. He is a C. S. Lewis scholar and the author of <em>Lewis Agonistes: How C. S. Lewis Can Train Us to Wrestle with the Modern and Postmodern World</em> (Broadman Holman).. . .through a well-written and scholarly book, Markos has enriched our engagement with the ancient texts and challenged our thinking as Christian readers.

Magazine, March/April 2008)<br><br>. . .an accessible and interesting treatment of the great classical works. (Ethan Cordray in Touchstone, March 2008)<br><br>. . . a great "crash course" on the anceint Greek and Roman myths. . . (Lee Sparks for Rev!, March/April 2008)<br><br>"At a time when our cultural memory seems to have faded away into obscurity--when to say that something 'is history' is anything but a compliment--Louis Markos wisely reminds us of our continuing debt to the great poets and dramatists of the ancient world. Through cogent readings of Homer, Sophocles, Virgil and others, he searches the classics of antiquity for 'traces, remnants and intimations of that wisdom which made us.' Written in a clear and compelling manner, this timely study deserves a wide audience." (Roger Lundin, Blanchard Professor of English, Wheaton College)<br><br>"From the earliest centuries of the church and throughout the Middle Ages, Christian thinkers pored over not only the Old Testament but Greek and Roman literature in search of foreshadowings of Christ. Christian readings of the classics fell out of favor in the modern world, but with <em>From Achilles to Christ</em> Louis Markos revives this venerable tradition. Professor Markos knows the difference between the Greeks and the gospel, but his illuminating interpretations of selected classics show that God did not leave the Athenians without a witness and capture the thrilling breadth of the evangelical proclamation that Jesus came 'in the fullness of the times.'" (Peter J. Leithart, Senior Fellow, New St. Andrews College, Moscow, Idaho, author of 'Deep Comedy: Trinity, Tragedy, and Hope in Western Literature')<br><br>"In <em>The Pilgrim's Regress</em> by C. S. Lewis, Father History explains how God sent the pagans pictures to reveal himself to them because, unlike the Jews, they had forgotten how to read. This is Lewis's way of echoing his friend Tolkien who insisted that the pagan myths contained 'splintered fragments' of the one true light that comes from God. Since we also live in an age that has forgotten how to read, we are in need of the pictures, presented by pagan mythology, as a means of seeing the prefiguration of Christ. Through this mythological prefiguration we can better understand the transfiguration of Christ in the Gospels. Christ reveals himself to us in these pagan pictures, and Louis Markos is an excellent guide to the allegorical icons to be found in them. I would go further: Louis Markos is one of the most exciting writers around today and there are few more able to lead us on a tour through God's gallery of myth than he is." (Joseph Pearce, Writer-in-Residence and Associate Professor of Literature, Ave Maria University)<br><br>"Louis Markos's <em>From Achilles to Christ</em> is a remarkable work of scholarship and insight, making clear the congruence of ancient Greek myth with Christian revelation. It is a particularly valuable study in a time of widespread amnesia concerning the classical past and its role in shaping Western culture. Markos knows his texts and approaches them with equal poetic and theological skills. <em>From Achilles to Christ</em> is a telling argument for the value of the classics in extending and deepening the Christian imagination." (Louise Cowan, University Professor, University of Dallas)<br><br>"This is a much-needed Christian introduction to the classical pagan sources that largely framed the Mediterranean culture in which Paul and other apostles proclaimed the gospel of redemption. The argument of this book would have been obvious to the church fathers, nearly all of whom were thoroughly familiar with the ancient literature that the author recommends to our study."

Sailors, not metallic superstructures and hulls, had won the battles and become the stuff of legend. Men like Commander Donald MacDonald, skipper of the USS <i>O'Bannon</i>, who became the most decorated naval officer of the Pacific war; Lieutenant Hugh Barr Miller, who survived his ship's sinking and waged a one-man battle against the enemy while stranded on a Japanese-occupied island; and Doctor Dow "Doc" Ransom, the beloved physician of the USS <i>La Vallette</i>, who combined a mixture of humor and medical expertise to treat his patients at sea, epitomize the sacrifices made by all the men and women of World War II.<br><br>Through diaries, personal interviews with survivors, and letters written to and by the crews during the war, preeminent historian of the Pacific theater John Wukovits brings to life the human story of the squadron and its men who bested the Japanese in the Pacific and helped take the war to Tokyo.<br></p><p><b>John Wukovits</b> is a military expert specializing in the Pacific theater of World War II. He is the author of many books, including<i> Hell from the Heavens</i>, <i>For Crew and Country</i>, <i>One Square Mile of Hell</i>, and <i>Pacific Alamo</i>. He has also written numerous articles for such publications as <i>WWII History</i>, <i>Naval History</i>, and <i>World War II</i>. He lives in Michigan."Wukovits certainly joins [Samuel Eliot] Morrison and James D. Hornfischer as one of the pre-eminent writers on the history of U.S. Navy operations in the Pacific theater...Thanks should go not only to those veterans who want their story told before they're gone but as well to those like John Wukovits who do the telling in a well presented and poignantly human written manner."&#x2015;<b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><br>"Authors such as John Wukovits do all of us a great service by researching the lives of ships and sailors, and putting these stirring tales before a public often far too ignorant of their heritage...A well-researched, well-written and well-edited book, sure to stir the imaginations of many veterans, and well worth the time of adventure-loving civilians." &#x2015;<b><i>Roanoke Times</i></b><br><br>"The strength of Tin Can Titans is that Mr. Wukovits has ferreted out deeply personal stories of the officers and enlisted men who experienced hell aboard these destroyers. Their diaries, letters and personal reminiscences, as well as the action reports from their commanders, convey the horrors of pitching decks, exploding shrapnel and gut-wrenching fear." &#x2015;<b><i>Walter Borneman, Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"An inspiring story of courage, duty, sacrifice, and devotion to country in the most trying and dangerous of circumstances. It's an epic story about decisive actions in a large Pacific war. But it's mostly a story about American sailors at war...most of them civilians who donned uniforms for the duration when their country needed them, and who went back, those who survived, to their civilian lives when the shooting stopped...Destroyers were workhorses in the Pacific, and elsewhere. It's right that their story is told too, as it is so well in Tin Can Titans. These are ships and Americans that should not be forgotten."&#x2015;<b><i>The American Spectator</i></b><br><br>"[Wukovits] draws overdue attention to the heroism, dedication, and courage of the young destroyer sailors...[He] does a masterful job capturing the day-to-day boredom, excitement, and fear ordinary tin can sailors experienced on routine patrols at the height of the Pacific war. He expertly weaves together monthly war diaries, action reports, and ships' histories, as well as interviews and oral histories from the officers and sailors that lived, fought, and often died together...Wukovits makes no claim that DesRon 21 single-handedly won the war, but he gives the men that fought in the squadron their due."&#x2015;<b><i>America in WWII</i></b><br><br>"<i>Tin Can Titans</i> is history with humanity, and should be of interest to any current student of Americana, and to any of the fading generations who still have close ties to our last great war."<br>&#x2015;<b>Curled Up with a Good Book</b><br><br>"A story of valor, sacrifice, and endurance and one that is well told...The author is a well-known military historian with vast experience on the Pacific war, and this expertise shines through in his latest book...The clear writing and thorough research combine to make a readable and enjoyable volume."&#x2015;<b>WWII History</b><br><br>"[Wukovits] interviewed former squadron members and mined the letters and diaries of the crews to present the Pacific War through their eyes."&#x2015;<b>Seapower</b><br><br>"A lively and briskly written account of destroyer squadron operations...Anyone interested in destroyer operations in general or those of the USN in particular will find this title worth consideration."&#x2015;<b>Warship International</b><br><br>"An excellent narrative of the blue-collar destroyers...Wukovits keeps the reader engaged with interesting stories and nonstop action."<br>&#x2015;<b>Collected Miscellany</b></p><h2>Early Intervention for Reading Difficulties: The Interactive Strategies Approach</h2><p>Grounded in a strong evidence base, this indispensable practitioner guide and text has given thousands of teachers tools to support the literacy growth of beginning and struggling readers in grades K&#x2013;2.

Findings from studies that she and her colleagues conducted contributed to the emergence of response to intervention as a process for preventing reading difficulties and avoiding inappropriate and inaccurate learning disability classifications. Most recently, Dr. Scanlon&#x2019;s work has focused on the development of teacher knowledge and teaching skill among both preservice and inservice teachers for the purpose of helping teachers to prevent reading difficulties in young children and remediate reading difficulties among older children.<br><br> Kimberly L.

They draw on their own and others' research to show how we can greatly reduce the prevalence of reading difficulties. The book addresses many facets of literacy development--from phonological awareness to reading comprehension--and shows how to organize instruction to respond to each child's needs. I am thrilled that the authors have developed a second edition of this book! I used the first edition in my preservice literacy methods course and as a trusted resource in my work with practicing teachers, and the second edition provides even more guidance. If you are an early literacy teacher educator, coach, or specialist, I strongly urge you to put this book on your reading list. You won't be disappointed."--Nell K. Duke, EdD, School of Education, University of Michigan&nbsp;<br><br> "If you really want to know how to teach young children to read, this is a good place to start. In their second edition, the authors have perfected the ISA, based on hundreds of hours of work with beginning readers. What is truly remarkable is the degree of detail about every aspect of the beginning reading lesson, from phonological awareness to fluency. I would use this book as a primary text in an elementary methods course or in a graduate reading specialist or special education course."--Heidi Anne E. Mesmer, PhD, School of Education, Virginia Tech<br><br> "What a fantastic resource for anyone who teaches reading in the primary grades! What sets the second edition apart for me is that every section now includes an excellent discussion of possible challenges for English learners (ELs), along with recommendations for instructional modifications, making it a great resource for EL educators as well as reading teachers."--Karen L. Ford, PhD, Curry School of Education, University of Virginia<br><br> "A valuable resource for all early elementary teachers, whether they want to improve their implementation of reading interventions or build knowledge about effective reading instruction more generally. Detailed descriptions of research-based practices, along with many practical tools, make intervention planning and implementation more feasible."--Jeanne Wanzek, PhD, Department of Special Education, Vanderbilt University<br><br> "I used the first edition of this text in professional development courses with practicing teachers, reading specialists, and administrators, and I'm delighted to see the second edition. The ISA is responsive to students and it empowers teachers as professional decision makers. This is a refreshing approach in contrast to prepackaged intervention materials or scripted reading programs. The content in this text is firmly based on sound research and is presented in an approachable manner."--Seth A.

Every window here on the seventh floor was open, and summer had officially departed six days ago, but that was Washington for you. When air-conditioning might come to the <i>Star</i> seemed to be a perennial matter of sad-sack speculation among the staff: &#x201c;When hell freezes over,&#x201d; went one answer Tim had heard in his three months here. &#x201c;Because then we won&#x2019;t need it.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss McGrory, one of the paper&#x2019;s book reviewers, arrived with a bottle of whiskey, which she set down next to the punch bowl and cake, whose single chocolate layer and frosted inscription, &#x201c;Happy Trails, Sheriff,&#x201d; would soon be cut into by the retirement party&#x2019;s guest of honor, Mr. Yost, a pressman who&#x2019;d been at the <i>Star</i> since 1912 and took his nickname from a weekend job he had as a constable over in Berwyn Heights.<br><br>More people drifted in. &#x201c;We could use a piano,&#x201d; opined Miss Eversman, the music critic. She&#x2019;d covered Liberace&#x2019;s concert two nights ago at Constitution Hall and was telling a police reporter that the pianist&#x2019;s mother had been in the president&#x2019;s box with one of Liberace&#x2019;s brothers, Rudy, who&#x2019;d served in Korea.<br><br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s got one boy who&#x2019;s a soldier?&#x201d; asked the reporter. &#x201c;Maybe she&#x2019;s got hope of grandchildren after all.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Eversman laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Forget Liberace,&#x201d; said Mr. Yost, who&#x2019;d started to reminisce about his first years here at the paper. &#x201c;I remember seeing Wilson himself&#x2014;that&#x2019;s <i>Woodrow</i> Wilson, not Charlie, to you youngsters&#x2014;up in <i>his</i> box at Keith&#x2019;s Theatre. You wouldn&#x2019;t have figured it from an egghead like him, but did that man ever love his vaudeville. You could sell him any player-piano roll the minute it came out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We really <i>do</i> need a piano,&#x201d; Miss Eversman sighed, as the national and managing editors walked in. Mr. Corn and Mr. Noyes took up positions off to the side of things and remarked to each other, a bit shamefacedly, on the smallness of the spread.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Mr. Corn, quoting the late Senator Taft&#x2019;s famously impolitic advice about higher food prices: &#x201c;Eat less.&#x201d;<br><br>The party was making Tim feel nostalgic, and thus a bit foolish, since he&#x2019;d been, after all, only a summer hire allowed to stay on through September&#x2014;or, more exactly, this coming Friday afternoon. They&#x2019;d put him in the city room, even though he&#x2019;d never been to Washington before June and knew nothing about the District as a place where many citizens lived life quite oblivious to the federal government. His placement, he&#x2019;d come to understand, was typical of the <i>Star</i>, a paper both venerable and feckless, produced each evening by an eccentric, occasionally brilliant staff. He had liked it here and would miss the place, but given the shortness of his tenure he wasn&#x2019;t sure he should even take a piece of the cake once it got cut.<br><br>A small stack of the paper&#x2019;s early edition lay atop an open drawer of the file cabinet he was leaning against. Ambassador Bohlen was flying home from Moscow to talk with Secretary Dulles, and this morning Louis Budenz, a Fordham professor and former red, had testified to the McCarthy committee that, in his &#x201c;humble opinion,&#x201d; parts of an Army-commissioned pamphlet about Siberia&#x2014;something put together to educate the Far Eastern Command&#x2014;contained large chunks of Soviet-sympathizing stuff that had been taken, without footnotes or refutation, from Communist writers.<br><br>Cecil Holland, the reporter who&#x2019;d written the Budenz story, now saw Tim reading it and asked, &#x201c;Laughlin, you just graduated from Fordham, didn&#x2019;t you? Ever study with this guy who says the army&#x2019;s been indoctrinating itself?&#x201d;<br><br>Tim smiled. &#x201c;I had somebody else for Economics, Mr. Holland.&#x201d; He grimaced. &#x201c;I think I got a C-plus.&#x201d; Holland laughed and walked over to claim a piece of the cake that had finally been sliced.<br><br>At Fordham, Tim had mostly studied American history and English literature, and his plan in coming to Washington remained, even now, to combine his major and minor into a job writing for a politician, though throughout the city&#x2019;s hot, depopulated summer he&#x2019;d made little headway finding anything on Capitol Hill. Well, he&#x2019;d have plenty of time and motivation come Friday afternoon!<br><br>The party conversation had turned to Senator McCarthy&#x2019;s imminent wedding. &#x201c;What kind of guy picks lunch hour on Tuesday to get married in a church?&#x201d; asked the financial-page editor.<br><br>&#x201c;A guy who&#x2019;s busy taking over the world,&#x201d; answered Cecil Holland.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s marrying a girl on his staff,&#x201d; added the police reporter. &#x201c;Maximum efficiency. She&#x2019;ll be able to crank out the press release for Joe&#x2019;s firstborn as soon as she&#x2019;s cranked out the baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, from what I hear,&#x201d; said Miss Eversman, &#x201c;McCarthy&#x2019;s mother might be more surprised by all this than Liberace&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Everyone had heard the rumors.<br><br>Would the president show up for the wedding? People began to take bets. Ike&#x2019;s contempt for McCarthy was by now well developed, but it would be hard, some argued, for him not to put in an appearance, now that he was back from vacation, and with St. Matthew&#x2019;s being only a few blocks from the White House.<br><br>Miss McGrory, who appeared to regard this talk of McCarthy on the order of a frog in the punch bowl, returned to an earlier subject and insisted that they didn&#x2019;t <i>need</i> a piano. She patted Mr. Yost&#x2019;s arm and dared him to get everybody started singing &#x201c;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&#x201d;&#x2014;Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s absolute all-time favorite, the retiring pressman had reminded them.<br><br>Tim, who had been to all the West Side weddings of his uncountable cousins, right away felt Irish instinct trump shyness. He joined in as soon as Mr. Yost and Miss McGrory got things going, and within a moment, even as he remained alone with his thoughts, was singing the same words as everyone else:<br><br><i>Let me put my arms about you,</i><br><i>I don&#x2019;t want to live without you.</i><br><br>His job at the <i>Star</i> had come through the nephew of an old pal of his dad&#x2019;s from Manhattan Criminal Court, where Paul Laughlin had worked during what everyone in the family now called the old days&#x2014;the ones before Mr. Laughlin, nearing forty, put himself through LaSalle, by correspondence and then at night, completing his transformation from process server into accountant, making possible his family&#x2019;s move from Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen to the unimaginably big and bright new rooms of Stuyvesant Town. Those rooms seemed even larger now that Tim&#x2019;s older sister, Frances, the Laughlins&#x2019; only other child, had gone off to Staten Island to live with her husband.<br><br><i>If you ever leave me, how my heart would ache,</i><br><i>I want to hug you but I fear you&#x2019;d break&#x2014;</i><br><br>While singing these lines, Tim realized that most of the partygoers&#x2019; eyes were on him. His pleasing tenor voice&#x2014;a surprise to those who&#x2019;d heard only his soft, polite speech with its occasional stammer&#x2014;had risen above everyone else&#x2019;s in volume, though to anybody paying attention to the lyric, it seemed far more likely that any hugging to involve this five-foot-seven, 130-pound young man would result in his breakage, not the girl&#x2019;s. Realizing what had provoked the attention and smiles, Tim blushed and lowered his voice, while everybody else raised theirs for the song&#x2019;s big finish:<br><br><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh,</i><br><i>Oh, you beautiful doll!</i><br><br>Mr. Yost led the revelers&#x2019; applause for themselves, and when it subsided, Mr. Brogan, Tim&#x2019;s boss on the city desk, announced: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear to me that we kept too much of Laughlin&#x2019;s light under a bushel this summer. I wish we&#x2019;d had more for you to do, Timmy.&#x201d;<br><br>Tim smiled and thanked him. Since June he&#x2019;d mostly typed and done rewrites, bringing the perfect grammar of the nuns to the fitfully produced copy of the oldest city reporters, who teased him about being a college man, and about a pretty girl named Helen, another summer hire who answered a phone in Classifieds and sometimes stopped to chat at his desk.<br><br>They might have kept on teasing him now, but they didn&#x2019;t really know enough about this conscientious, if cheerful, boy, and so the spotlight soon moved elsewhere. Tim shrank back into himself as Cecil Holland redirected the conversation to&#x2014;what else?&#x2014;the senator from Wisconsin.<br><br>What would McCarthy do next? people wanted to know. Holland advised them to watch what was going on up in New York: Cohn had been running subcommittee meetings there, taking testimony in closed sessions when he wasn&#x2019;t snooping around Fort Monmouth over in Jersey. You watch: McCarthy would soon be taking shots at the army for whatever security breaches he could discover or invent.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna love you, like nobody&#x2019;s loved you, come Cohn or come Schine,&#x201d; crooned the police reporter, reprising a song spoof from last spring, when McCarthy staffers Roy Cohn and David Schine, colleagues and pals (some people said more), had gone on their tour of USIA libraries in Europe, ridding the shelves of anti-American books by Ameri- can authors.<br><br>No one ever talked half so much about Eisenhower as they did about McCarthy, Tim reflected; the senator was as constantly on people&#x2019;s lips as FDR had been when he was a boy, even if the only other thing Roosevelt and McCarthy might have in common was the admiration of Tim&#x2019;s father. Paul Laughlin still revered FDR (Mrs. R was now another story), as he had since the First Hundred Days. Before the arrival of the New Deal, already the father of two babies, Mr. Laughlin had spent plenty of afternoons playing stickball on the pavements of the West Fifties, unable to scare up any work pushing dress racks or plastering or even delivering groceries to widows in their Ninth Avenue walkups. But by the end of &#x2019;33, Paul Laughlin had become, according to the family joke, &#x201c;the oldest man in the CCC,&#x201d; upstate for weeks at a time, cutting down trees or planting new ones for what was at least half a living wage. Some kindhearted supervisor took notice of his hard work and referred him to a pal in the courts, where he worked his way up toward something like security and, at last, the cessation of sleepless nights.<br><br>Nothing&#x2014;not even Grandma Gaffney&#x2019;s cutlery-tapping recaps of every Father Coughlin broadcast&#x2014;had ever put Mr. Laughlin off Roosevelt. He remained true to the president&#x2019;s memory even when the war ended and the accounting money started coming in and he began bringing the <i>Journal-American</i> instead of the <i>Post</i> home to Stuy Town, which he eventually took to reminding them had been built by a private insurance company, not as a government project. By the time Tim was finishing high school, he&#x2019;d gotten used to hearing his father say that Bishop Sheen&#x2014;fine anti-red that he might be&#x2014;nonetheless had a foolish sympathy for some of the labor unions. And a couple of years after that, once the television came into the living room, Dean Acheson could not come on it without Mr. Laughlin announcing, in sarcastic imitation: &#x201c;I will not turn my back on Alger Hiss.&#x201d; The line always made Tim and Frances laugh, as if Acheson were not a person but a corporation with a trademark pledge, like &#x201c;Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.&#x201d;<br><br>But for all that, Tim saw no reason why his father&#x2014;the mildest of Cold Warriors, really, looking eastward not so much for invading Soviets as for the house he now hoped to buy in Nassau County&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t right about the fundamentals of politics.<br><br>Mr. Brogan, Tim now noticed, had been buttonholed by Betty Beale, one of the society reporters.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Canby isn&#x2019;t pulling her weight?&#x201d; asked Brogan, laughing. &#x201c;You <i>shock</i> me, Miss Beale.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Joke if you want,&#x201d; said the reporter, to whom the women&#x2019;s-page editor was a constant thorn in the side. Miss Beale took her own work seriously and made a point of actually <i>going</i> to the events she covered, not just relying on a phone call to the hostess to ask what cabinet wife had &#x201c;poured&#x201d; for which white-gloved ladies in attendance. &#x201c;I cannot do this wedding alone,&#x201d; she now told Mr. Brogan. &#x201c;We need more than one piece out of it&#x2014;something for tomorrow&#x2019;s edition, something for the next day, and something for my weekend column. You know, Mr. Brogan, tonight McCarthy and his fianc�e are having a buffet supper at some friend&#x2019;s farm out in Maryland, and thanks to Miss Canby there will be no one present from the <i>Star</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The city editor continued listening as Miss Beale thrust home. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>McCarthy</i>, Mr. Brogan. It may be just a wedding, but surely this spills into your bailiwick&#x2014;and even Mr. Corn&#x2019;s. May I <i>please</i> get a little help?&#x201d;<br><br>Brogan looked around thoughtfully, until he spotted Tim, still standing against the filing cabinet. &#x201c;How about making use of this fine fellow, Miss Beale? He can spell, he&#x2019;s got a few Hibernian freckles, and he can even sing. Surely he can get the goods on an Irish wedding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about it, cookie?&#x201d; Miss Beale asked Tim. &#x201c;Do you think you can get the names of the people in as many pews as possible? And get as many quotes as they&#x2019;re willing to sling along with the rice? The reception&#x2019;s at the Washington Club right afterward. You can go to that, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Tim moved away from the filing cabinet and said sure. It was the only word he&#x2019;d ever spoken to the still youthful but formidable Miss Beale.<br><br>&#x201c;Good, then,&#x201d; said Brogan, having settled the matter.<br><br>&#x201c;Better than good,&#x201d; said Cecil Holland, who&#x2019;d overheard the exchange. &#x201c;If Laughlin ever gets hauled in and investigated for anything, he can always say, &#x2018;But, Joe, I was at your <i>wedding</i>, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The bottle Miss McGrory had brought in was by now pretty well drained, and a sizable body of those in attendance were thinking about adjourning to the Old Ebbitt Grill over on F Street. Tim&#x2019;s momentary celebrity earned him an invitation to join the group, but he decided he&#x2019;d be better off boning up for this opportunity he&#x2019;d just been given, however late in the game it had come. And so within ten minutes he was on his way home with someone&#x2019;s copy of the <i>Congressional Directory</i>, the deluxe edition with photographs. He could study the pictures tonight and increase the percentage of guests he&#x2019;d recognize.<br><br>Passing the Old Post Office on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, he was reminded that he&#x2019;d yet to mail home the letter he&#x2019;d been carrying around for the past two days. In it he made his job prospects sound a lot rosier than they actually were&#x2014;but then again, who knew? Maybe this assignment was a portent of better things that might be coming once he left the paper and got back to passing out his r�sum�, this time in earnest, on Capitol Hill.<br><br>Should he go up to Hecht&#x2019;s and get a new white shirt? The collar was frayed on the only laundered one he had left. No, too expensive, he decided; he would settle for getting his shoes shined at Union Station tonight. Walking along Fifth Street, above Indiana and D, he continued on his career-conscious train of thought, contemplating the signs for lawyers and bondsmen, knowing that the former profession was still too much to aspire to, even if the latter one, like process-serving, now resided in a realm his father had lifted the Laughlins permanently above.<br><br>He bought a pint of milk and a sandwich before reaching his room on the Hill, in the two-hundred block of Pennsylvania, one flight above a hardware store. His occupancy was illegal, the lower floors of the building being zoned only for offices, but a landlady with no vacancies a couple of blocks away had tipped him off to the nice Italian owner here, who told hi...</p><h2>Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead</h2><p><p>The Grateful Dead are perhaps the most legendary American rock band of all time. For thirty years, beginning in the hippie scene of San Francisco in 1965, they were a musical institution, the original jam band that broke new ground in so many ways. From the music to their live concert sound systems and fan recordings, they were forward-thinking champions of artistic control and outlaw artists who marched to the beat of their own drums.</p><p>In <i>Deal</i>, Bill Kreutzmann, one of their founding members and drummer for every one of their over 2,300 concerts has written an unflinching and wild account of playing in the greatest improvisational band of all time. Everything a rock music fan would expect is here, but what sets this apart is Bill's incredible life of adventure that was at the heart of the Grateful Dead experience. This was a band that knew no limits and Bill lived life to the fullest, pushing the boundaries of drugs, drums and high times, through devastating tragedy and remarkable triumph.</p><p>But at this book's beating heart is the music--theirs and others. Some of the greatest musicians and concerts were a part of the Grateful Dead's career, from sharing the stage with Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, and The Who, to playing in the Acid Tests, The Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock and Altamont. Bill's life is a chronicle of American music and pop culture history and his epic personal journey is one of sonic discovery and thrilling experiences.</p></p><p><p>BILL KREUTZMANN co-founded the Grateful Dead in 1965 with his musical cohorts Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, and Phil Lesh. As the drummer in that band for all 30 years until they disbanded in 1995, he performed more than 2,300 concerts and played on every one of their albums. He continues to play music in various bands including Billy and the Kids. He lives on an organic farm in Hawaii.</p><p>BENJY EISEN has written for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Relix</i> and so on. He lives in San Francisco, where he is at work on a novel. Upon completion of <i>Deal</i>, he cut a deal with Kreutzmann and is now his manager.</p>''Bill Kreutzmann, founding drummer of the Grateful Dead, has produced more than just a tourist's guide. What emanates, maybe more than he intended, is a testimony to friendship and profound sadness when it abruptly ends.'' --<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>''A memoir of his years with the anarchic band that became an unlikely American institution... Kreutzmann and co-author Benjy Eisen recount the Dead's formation, its zigzagging rise, and many low points. Unlike other books about the Grateful Dead's history, Mr. Kreutzmann homes in on his own experiences with the group. Deal chronicles partying with John Belushi, riding camels through the desert to a Bedouin musical jam, and encountering George McGovern's presidential campaign in 1972.'' --<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>''Readers dropping into Grateful Dead drummer Kreutzmann's stream of memory may be surprised by only one overriding theme: namely, the frequency of bitter episodes of discord, always roiling under the surface of a good-time psychedelic jug band that slowly emerged as a stadium filler.'' --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>''The book's last forty or so pages, which recount Jerry Garcia's death and its aftermath, are tremendously moving, and here the work finally hits its stride.'' --<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>''Like one of the Dead's meandering, free-form jams...[Kreutzmann] provides his own history of the Dead through chronicles of the band's albums and the personnel involved in making them...Kreutzmann offers his take on each band member, recalling many of his long, strange trips on various hallucinogens, as well as the ups and downs of his personal life.'' --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>''The uninhibited (of course) tale of the co-founder of the legendary rock band, who played drums at every single one of the Dead's 2,300 concerts and lived to tell about it all.'' --<i>Tampa Bay Times</i><br><br>''Taking its title from a Jerry Garcia solo song the band was fond of playing, the book's understandable and blatant subjectivity of the Dead's story is a given...[and] offers plenty of insight, opinion, observations, and analysis that are unique and of great interest to fans.'' --<i>Houston Press</i></p><h2>Give Up Your Glasses For Good: Holistic Eye Care for the 21st Century</h2><p>Give Up Your Glasses for Good is a step by step self-healing course that teaches you how to improve your vision naturally.

Price is the place where value and money meet. From the global release of the latest electronic gadget to the bewildering gyrations of oil futures to markdowns at the bargain store, price is the most powerful and pervasive economic force in our day-to-day lives and one of the least understood.</p><p>The recipe for successful pricing often sounds like an exotic cocktail, with equal parts psychology, economics, strategy, tools and incentives stirred up together, usually with just enough math to sour the taste. That leads managers to water down the drink with hunches and rules of thumb, or leave out the parts with which they don&#x2019;t feel comfortable. While this makes for a sweeter drink, it often lacks the punch to have an impact on the customer or on the business.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way, though, as Hermann Simon illustrates through dozens of stories collected over four decades in the trenches and behind the scenes. A world-renowned speaker on pricing and a trusted advisor to Fortune 500 executives, Simon&#x2019;s lifelong journey has taken him from rural farmers&#x2019; markets, to a distinguished academic career, to a long second career as an entrepreneur and management consultant to companies large and small throughout the world.

Members of the Jedi order, even Masters such as Luke, didn&#x2019;t accumulate much personal property. Within view were chairs situated in front of unlit computer screens; a wall rack holding plasteel staves and other practice weapons; a table littered with personal effects such as datapads, notes scrawled on scraps of flimsi, datachips holding reports from various Jedi Masters, and a crude and not at all accurate sandglass statuette in Luke&#x2019;s image sent to him by a child from Tatooine. Inset into the stone-veneer walls were drawers holding his and Mara&#x2019;s limited selection of clothes. Their lightsabers were behind Luke, resting on a shelf on the headboard of their bed.<br><br>His wife, Mara Jade Skywalker, had more personal items and equipment, of course. Disguises, weapons, communications gear, falsified documents. A former spy, she had never given up the trappings of that trade, but those items weren&#x2019;t here. Luke wasn&#x2019;t sure where she kept them. She didn&#x2019;t bother him with such details.<br><br>Beside him, she stirred, and he glanced down at her. Her red hair, kept a medium length this season, was an unruly mess, but there was no sleepiness in her eyes when they opened. In brighter light, he knew, those eyes were an amazing green. &#x201c;Who doesn&#x2019;t exist?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. An enemy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You dreamed about him?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the dream a couple of times before. It&#x2019;s not just a dream. It&#x2019;s coming to me through currents in the Force. He&#x2019;s all wrapped up in shadows&#x2014;a dark hooded cloak, but more than that, shadows of light and . . .&#x201d; Luke shook his head, struggling for the correct word. &#x201c;And ignorance. And denial. And he brings great pain to the galaxy . . . and to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if he brings pain to the galaxy, you&#x2019;re obviously going to feel it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, to me personally, in addition to his other evil.&#x201d; Luke sighed and lay down again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too vague. And when I&#x2019;m awake, when I try to peer into the future to find him, I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he doesn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the dream tells me.&#x201d; Luke hissed in aggravation.<br><br>&#x201c;Could it be Raynar?&#x201d;<br><br>Luke considered. Raynar Thul, former Jedi Knight, presumed dead during the Yuuzhan Vong war, had been discovered a few years earlier&#x2014;horribly burned during the war, mentally transformed in the years since through his involvement with the insectoid Killik race. That transformation had been a malevolent one, and the Jedi order had had to deal with him. Now he languished in a well-protected cell deep within the Jedi Temple, undergoing treatment for his mental and physical afflictions.<br><br>Treatment. Treatment meant change; perhaps, in changing, Raynar was becoming something new, and Luke&#x2019;s presentment pointed toward the being Raynar would someday become.<br><br>Luke shook his head and pushed the possibility away. &#x201c;In this vision, I don&#x2019;t sense Raynar&#x2019;s alienness. Mentally, emotionally, whoever it is remains human, or near human. There&#x2019;s even the possiblity that it&#x2019;s my father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Darth Vader.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Before he was Darth Vader. Or just when he was becoming Vader.&#x201d; Luke&#x2019;s gaze lost focus as he tried to recapture the dream. &#x201c;What little of his face I can see reminds me of the features of Anakin Skywalker as a Jedi. But his eyes . . . as I watch, they turn a molten gold or orange, transforming from Force-use and anger . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have an idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wait until he shows up, then crush him.&#x201d;<br><br>Luke smiled. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; He closed his eyes and his breathing slowed, an effort to return to sleep.<br><br>Within a minute the rhythm of his breathing became that of natural sleep.<br><br>But Mara lay awake, her attention on the ceiling&#x2014;beyond it, through dozens of floor levels of the Jedi enclave to the skies of Coruscant above&#x2014;and searched for any hint, any flicker of what it was that was causing her husband worry.<br><br>She found no sign of it. And she, too, slept.<br><br>Adumar<br><br>The gleaming pearl-gray turbolift doors slid open sideways, and warm air bearing an aroma that advertised death and destruction washed over Jacen Solo, his cousin Ben Skywalker, and their guide.<br><br>Jacen took a deep breath and held it. The odors of this subterranean factory were not the smells of corrupted flesh or gangrenous wounds&#x2014;smells Jacen was familiar with&#x2014;but those of labor and industry. The great chamber before them had been a missile manufacturing center for decades, and no amount of rigorous cleaning would ever be quite able to eliminate the odors of sweat, machine lubricant, newly fabricated composite materials, solid fuel propellants, and high explosives that filled the air.<br><br>Jacen expelled the breath and stepped out of the turbolift, then walked the handful of steps up to the rail overlooking the chamber. He walked rapidly so that his Jedi cloak would billow a little as he strode, so that his boot heels would ring on the metal flooring of this observation catwalk, and so his apprentice and guide would be left behind for a moment. This was a performance for his guide and all the other representatives of the Dammant Killers company. Jacen knew he was carrying off his role quite well; the company officials he&#x2019;d been dealing with remained properly intimidated. But he didn&#x2019;t know whether to attribute his success to his bearing and manner, his lean, brooding, and handsome looks, or his name&#x2014;for on this world of Adumar, with its history of fascination with pilots, the name of Jacen&#x2019;s father, Han Solo, went a very long way.<br><br>His guide, a slender, balding man named Testan ke Harran, moved up to the rail to Jacen&#x2019;s right. Contrasting with the dull grays and blues that were common on this factory&#x2019;s walls and its workers&#x2019; uniforms, Testan was a riot of color&#x2014;his tunic, with its nearly knee-length hem and its flowing sleeves, was the precise orange of X-wing fighter pilot uniforms, though decorated with purple crisscross lines breaking it down into a flickering expanse of small diamond shapes, and his trousers, belt, and scarf were a gleaming gold.<br><br>Testan stroked his lustrous black beard, the gesture a failed attempt to conceal the man&#x2019;s nervousness. Jacen felt, rather than saw, Ben move up on the other side of Testan.<br><br>&#x201c;You can see,&#x201d; Testan said, &#x201c;ar workars enjoy very fan conditions.&#x201d;<br><br>Ben cleared his throat. &#x201c;He says their workers enjoy very fine conditions.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen nodded absently. He understood Testan&#x2019;s words, and it had taken him little time to learn and understand the Adumari accent, but this was another act, a ploy to keep the Adumari off-balance. He leaned forward to give the manufacturing floor below his full attention.<br><br>The room was large enough to act as a hangar and maintenance bay for four full squadrons of X-wing snubfighters. Tall duracrete partitions divided the space into eight lanes, each of which enclosed an assembly line; materials entered through small portals in the wall to the left, rolled along on luminous white conveyor belts, and eventually exited through portals on the far right. Laborers in gray jumpsuits flanked the belts and worked on the materials as they passed.<br><br>On the nearest belt, immediately below Jacen, the materials being worked on appeared to be compact visual sensor assemblies. The conveyor belt brought in eight such units and stopped. Moving quickly, the laborers plugged small cables into the units and turned to look into monitors, which showed black-and-white images of jumpsuited waists and worker hands. The workers turned the units this way and that, confirming that the sensors were properly calibrated.<br><br>One monitor never lit up with a view from the sensor. The worker on that unit unplugged it and set it on a table running parallel to the conveyor belt. A moment later, the other workers on this section unplugged their sensor units and the conveyor belt jerked into motion again, carrying the remaining seven units to the next station.<br><br>One lane over, the conveyor belt remained in constant motion, carrying sensor unit housings along. The workers on that belt, fewer in number than the sensor testers, reached out occasionally to turn a housing, to look inside, to examine the exterior for cracks or warping. Some workers, distributed at intervals along the line, rapped each housing with a small rubber-headed hammer. Jacen assumed they were listening for a musical tone he could not possibly hear at this distance over the roar of noise from the floor.<br><br>Another lane away from him, the workers were clad not in jumpsuits but in full-coverage hazardous materials suits of a lighter and more reflective gray than the usual worker outfit. Their conveyor belt carried white plates bearing irregular balls the size of a human head but a nearly luminous green. The belt stopped as each set of eight such balls entered the lane, giving the workers time to plunge needle-like sensors into each ball. They, too, checked monitors for a few seconds before withdrawing the needles to allow the balls to continue on. Jacen knew that poisonous green&#x2014;it was the color of the high explosive Adumari manufacturers used to fabricate the concussion missiles they exported.<br><br>While Jacen made his initial survey, Ben kept their guide occupied. &#x201c;Do you wax your beard?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I do not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It just seems very shiny. Do you oil it?&#x201d;<br><br>Testan&#x2019;s voice was a little more irritated in tone. &#x201c;I do not oil it. I condition it. And I brush it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you brush it with butter?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen finally looked to the right, past Testan and at his cousin. Ben was thirteen standard years of age, not tall but well muscled, with a fine-featured freckled face under a mass of flame-red hair. Ben turned, his face impassive, to look at Jacen, then said, &#x201c;The Jedi Knight acknowledges that this factory seems to meet the minimum, the absolute minimum, required safety and comfort standards of a Galactic Alliance military contractor.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen nodded. The nod meant Good improvisation. He was exerting no Force skill to communicate words to Ben; Ben&#x2019;s role was to pretend to act as his mentor&#x2019;s translator, when his actual function was to convince the locals that adult Jedi were even more aloof and mysterious than they had thought.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, no.&#x201d; Testan drew a sleeve over his brow, dabbing away a little perspiration. &#x201c;We are wall above minimam standards. Those duracrete barriars? They will vent any explosive farce upward, saving the majority of workars in case of calamity. Workar shifts are only two-fifths the day in length, unlike the old days.&#x201d;<br><br>Ben repeated Testan&#x2019;s words, and Jacen shrugged.<br><br>Ben imitated his motion. The gesture caused his own Jedi robe to gape open, revealing the lightsaber hanging from his belt.<br><br>Testan glanced at it, then looked back at Jacen, clearly worried. &#x201c;Your apprentice&#x2014;&#x201d; Unsure, he looked to Ben again. &#x201c;You are very young, are you not, to be wearing such a weapon?&#x201d;<br><br>Ben gave him a blank look. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a practice lightsaber.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Testan nodded as though he understood.<br><br>And there it was. Perhaps it was just the thought of a thirteen-year-old with a deadly cutting implement at hand, but Testan&#x2019;s defenses slipped enough that the worry began to pour through.</p><h2>The Jossey-Bass Reader on Educational Leadership</h2><p><b>The newest edition of the bestselling book on educational leadership</b> <p>This expanded and thoroughly updated edition of the popular anthology contains the articles, book excerpts, and seminal reports that define and drive the field of educational leadership today.

As aviation took off, speed and mileage were trumpeted on bold posters featuring busy routes. Major airlines produced highly stylized illustrations of their global presence, establishing now-classic brands. With trendy and forward-looking designs, cartographers celebrated the coming together of different cultures and made the earth look ever smaller. <br><br>Eventually, fleets got bigger and routes multiplied, and graphic designers have found creative new ways to display huge amounts of information. Airline hubs bring their own cultural mark and advertise their plentiful destination options. Innovative maps depict our busy world with webs of overlapping routes and networks of low-cost city-to-city hopping. But though flying has become more commonplace, Ovenden and Roberts remind us that early air travel was a glamorous affair for good reason. <i>Airline Maps</i> is a celebration of graphic design, cartographic skills and clever marketing, and a visual feast that reminds us to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.</p><p><b>Mark Ovenden</b> is a design historian, bestselling author, presenter, broadcaster, and lecturer. <br><b></b><br><b>Maxwell Roberts</b> is a lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Essex."[A] pictorial history&#x2014;complete with homages to previous map genres and plenty of art deco and mod aesthetics."<b>&#x2014;<i>The Atlantic</i>&#x2019;s CityLab&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;A celebration of air travel throughout the decades, [and] a visual reminder of how graphic design has evolved over the last hundred years.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Smithsonian.com<br><br></b>&#x201c;Beautiful . . . filled with images of vintage airline maps starting as early as 1919 . . .

Against the backdrop of the culture wars and before the rise of the Internet or desktop publishing, the zine and music culture of the Riot Grrrl movement empowered young women across the country to speak out against sexism and oppression, creating a powerful new force of liberation and unity within and outside of the women's movement. While feminist bands like Bikini Kill and Bratmobile fought for their place in a male-dominated punk scene, their members and fans developed an extensive DIY network of activism and support. <i>The Riot Grrrl Collection</i> reproduces a sampling of the original zines, posters, and printed matter for the first time since their initial distribution in the 1980s and '90s, and includes an original essay by Johanna Fateman and an introduction by Lisa Darms.</p><p><b>Lisa Darms</b> is Senior Archivist at the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections at New York University, and is founder of the Fales Riot Grrrl Collection.

But that is not the same as knowing what to do when you catch your son being<i> un</i>kind.&nbsp; A world-renowned developmental psychologist, Dr. Thomas Lickona has led the character education movement in schools for forty years. Now he shares with parents the vital tools they need to bring peace and foster cooperation at home. Kindness doesn&#x2019;t stand on its own. It needs a supporting cast of other essential virtues&#x2014;like courage, self-control, respect, and gratitude.&nbsp;<br><br> With concrete examples drawn from the many families Dr. Lickona has worked with over the years and clear tips you can act on tonight, <i>How to Raise Kind Kids</i> will help you give and get respect, hold family meetings to tackle persistent problems, discipline in a way that builds character, and improve the dynamic of your relationship with your children while putting them on the path to a happier and more fulfilling life.</p><p><b>DR. THOMAS LICKONA </b>is a developmental psychologist and longtime professor of education whose eight books on character education include <i>Raising Good Children </i>and <i>Educating for Character</i>. A past president of the Association for Moral Education, he received the &#x201c;Sandy&#x201d; Award for Lifetime Achievement in Character Education.This a book about kindness&#x2014;how to teach it to your children, foster it at home, and spread it beyond your immediate family. You may have picked it up because you are just starting out as a parent and want to do everything you can, from the outset, to nurture kindness in your child. Or you may feel you have a child who isn&#x2019;t kind&#x2014;or isn&#x2019;t as kind as you want them to be&#x2014;and you&#x2019;d like to try to change that. You may feel that all too often your family&#x2019;s interactions&#x2014;between adults, parent to kid, and among the kids themselves&#x2014;are not as respectful as you&#x2019;d hope. You&#x2019;d like to see more cooperation and less complaining.<br><br>Anyone who offers advice about parenting has to do so with great humility. You may have heard the story about the man who taught a class on child-rearing called Ten Commandments for Parents. People came from far and wide to learn how to be better parents. Then he got married, and he and his wife had a child. A couple of years later, he renamed his class Five Suggestions for Parents. Then they had another child, and not long after, he renamed the class Three Tentative Hints for Parents. After their third child was born, he stopped teaching the class altogether.<br><br>A humorous story but with a valid point: there&#x2019;s no secret formula for raising kids, no 10 easy steps that can guarantee the outcome. Raising human beings isn&#x2019;t like baking a cake or fixing a flat tire. As I watched my son valiantly trying to keep his cool while dealing with yet another conflict among his children, it seemed to me a more accurate title for the book you&#x2019;re about to read might be something like: <i>How, on Your Good Days, to Try to&nbsp;Get a Little Bit Better at Helping Your Kids Be a Little Bit Kinder</i>. But that was a lot to fit on the cover.<br><br>That said, I do believe there are important principles and practices&#x2014;some drawn from the wisdom of the ages, others from contemporary advances in moral development and brain research&#x2014;that can guide you in helping your child on the road to good character. We know that children thrive on a combination of support (lots of love) and challenge (high expectations and accountability). We know that good character involves knowing what&#x2019;s right, caring about what&#x2019;s right, and doing what&#x2019;s right&#x2014;and that <i>doing</i> is the hardest part. Modern moral psychology confirms what Aristotle taught centuries ago: We become good by doing good. For that reason, a parent has to be a &#x201c;character coach,&#x201d; teaching character skills like self-control and kindness in very deliberate ways and then helping kids practice them again and again, in everyday situations, until such behaviors become easier and more of a habit.<br><br>Being a character coach means giving your children opportunities for <i>moral action</i> in family life, such as doing chores; playing with, reading to, or caring for a younger brother or sister; helping without being asked; making amends after doing something wrong; and taking part in problem- solving sit-downs where everyone has a voice and responsibility to help to create a happier, more peaceful family. It also means talking to your kids about doing the right thing even when it&#x2019;s hard. It means helping your children to learn from their mistakes and to recognize the times when they may not have resisted temptation or peer pressure. You want them to know that being a good person and doing what&#x2019;s right often isn&#x2019;t easy, but that there&#x2019;s no other way to have self-respect or be truly happy.<br><br>The toughest part of being a character coach is doing so in the heat of the moment, when you&#x2019;re tired, frustrated, or running late&nbsp;and your kids are not doing what you ask or are on the verge of a meltdown. In the rough and tumble of family life, you usually haveto do something on the spot to deal with the problem at hand. At the same time, you want your immediate response to have longterm benefits that prevent variants of the scenario from happening again. You want to address undesirable behavior in a way that helps your children grow in maturity. You want to help them make progress toward becoming a person of character&#x2014;someone who is self-controlled, glad to be helpful, respectful, and brave enough to do what&#x2019;s right regardless of what others are doing.<br><br>Much of what I&#x2019;ve learned about parenting has come from my experiences in the trenches as a father of two boys and now as an observing and involved grandfather of fourteen children between the ages of five and twenty-two. I am, by training, a developmental psychologist with a specialization in the moral development of children and adolescents. My first book for parents, <i>Raising Good Children</i>, was a guide to help children develop through the stages of moral reasoning, the process of understanding why some actions are right and others wrong. But moral reasoning is only one part of character&#x2014;the &#x201c;head part.&#x201d; Good character also involves &#x201c;the heart&#x201d; (caring about what is right) and &#x201c;the hand&#x201d; (putting what you know to be right into practice). In my work with parents over the past fifty years, my focus has become character in the full sense: head, heart, and hand&#x2014;knowing the good, desiring the good, and doing the good.<br><br>During that same period, I was a professor of education at the State University of New York at Cortland&nbsp;in upstate New York,&nbsp;helping to prepare the next generation of teachers. A central pillar of my professional career has been training teachers to be character educators, and I continue to direct the character education&nbsp;center that I founded there. Most people who go into teaching want to make a difference in a child&#x2019;s life. There&#x2019;s no better way to do that than to help them develop good character.<br><br>Character education is not a new idea&#x2014;it&#x2019;s actually one of the oldest missions of American schools. In the early days of the republic, all kids had to go to school to learn two things: literacy and virtue. If there was to be government by the people, then these people would have to be committed to democracy&#x2019;s moral foundations: respect for the rights of individuals, voluntary compliance with the law, participation in public life, and concern for the common good. Benjamin Franklin said, &#x201c;Nothing is more important for the public good than to train up youth in wisdom and virtue.&#x201d;<br><br>Ben Franklin might be discouraged if he were around today. That&#x2019;s not to say that there weren&#x2019;t problems in his day, but at this point in our nation&#x2019;s moral journey, it can sometimes seem like we&#x2019;re going backward. In public opinion polls, a majority of adults say they think most Americans are less moral than they used to be. They think that our political system is broken and that the government doesn&#x2019;t listen to or care about people like them.<br><br>But there are signs of a movement afoot&#x2014;even in our current, often unkind culture&#x2014;to change this. To be sure, it remains an uphill battle, and it will take the two great formative institutions&#x2014;the family and school&#x2014;working together to turn things around. Of those two institutions, the family has the job of laying down the first building blocks of morality and character. In principle, schools build on that base and extend it, but many families have been so dissatisfied with what they have found at school that they have chosen to take on the task of educating their children themselves at home. Just as often, schools feel that parents aren&#x2019;t doing their part to teach things like respect and kindness, leaving teachers to take up the slack.<br><br>In the early nineties, national organizations such as the Character Education Partnership (now Character.org) and Character Counts! came on the scene to promote the goal of comprehensive character education in every school. A strong partnership with parents was a pillar of this movement, whose ultimate aim was for every child to attend a school where he or she would be valued and cared for in a productive learning environment where they would be taught to practice the virtues that make up good character. We&#x2019;re a long way from achieving that goal, but the vision is out there.<br><br>At the same time that character education was gaining momentum, we launched the Center for the 4th and 5th Rs (Respectand Responsibility) at SUNY Cortland. I had been gathering best practices in character education for many years, working with teachers and studying exemplary schools across the United States and Canada. Drawing on those practices, I published <i>Educating for Character: How Our Schools Can Teach Respect and Responsibility</i>, which caught the wave of the growing interest in character education. Soon after that, our Center began training principals and teachers in the comprehensive approach that <i>Educating for Character</i> described. Today, initiatives like Harvard&#x2019;s Making Caring Common and the Leadership Academy for Character Education at the University of Missouri at St. Louis are providing fresh impetus for the character education movement.<br><br>From the perspective of character education, every moment ofthe school day is a &#x201c;character moment.&#x201d; Every experience, every interaction&#x2014; in classrooms, in corridors, on the playground, at the Friday-night football game&#x2014;has the potential to shape the values and character of a child, for good or for ill. That&#x2019;s even more true of the interactions you have with your child at home. You are your child&#x2019;s first and potentially most powerful character educator. I hope this book will offer you hope, affirm the good things you&#x2019;re already doing, and give you some new strategies for your toolbox that will help you support your child&#x2019;s character development andcreate a culture of kindness and respect in your home.<br><br><b>The Challenge</b><br><br>Parenting is the hardest job on the planet. It taxes our energies and tests our character. We often see our own faults&#x2014;pride, impatience, a strong will, a short temper&#x2014;reflected or magnified in our children. &#x201c;God gives us children to teach us humility,&#x201d; sighed a young mother of a four-year-old boy.<br><br>Every child is different. Temperaments vary widely. Some kids are calm, some hyper. Some are focused and organized, others impulsive and distractible. Some are very sensitive and dissolve into tears at the slightest scolding. With others, our words seem to go in one ear and out the other. Some seem to come by sharing and generosity naturally. Others struggle to acquire such behaviors. Some seem born to be cooperative and obedient; others are stubborn and always testing the limits. Many are relatively easy during the childhood years but tougher in the teens. With others, just the opposite is true. Boys and girls present different challenges, and not necessarily in predictable patterns.<br><br>All of this makes parenting an art, not a science. From infancy on, we have to try to understand our children&#x2019;s individual personalities, pay attention to how they respond to what we do and to the world around them, find out what works best in eliciting their strengths, and help them with their difficulties. And no matter how much we learn from living with them or from reading books or taking courses on parenting, there will still be aspects of our children&#x2019;s individual personalities and our relationships with them that we may never fully understand.<br><br>Nevertheless, we should begin to think now about the kind of people we hope our children will be when they are grown men and women. Wise parents see themselves as &#x201c;raising adults.&#x201d; Will they be responsible adults who live by high moral standards? Will they make faithful husbands and wives and loving mothers and fathers? Will they contribute meaningfully to their community and to society?<br><br>This is not to say we control the outcome. Some years ago, after I spoke to parents at a high school, a mother came up to me and said: &#x201c;I have three sons. The first two are hardworking and responsible. The third says he&#x2019;s a hedonist. He&#x2019;s twenty-six and says his sole purpose in life is to have a good time. Where did I go wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>After a lighthearted reassurance that &#x201c;two out of three isn&#x2019;t bad,&#x201d; I reminded her that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between our efforts as parents and how our kids turn out. We do not create the person our child becomes. That is influenced by a host of factors, including their genes and innate temperament; the idiosyncrasies of their brains; the ever-changing world they&#x2019;re growing up in; their teachers, coaches, and schools; the presence or absence of a spiritual support system in their lives and a belief in something larger than themselves; the company they keep and the popular culture, social media, and other influences they take into their minds, hearts, and souls.<br><br>To a large degree, our children create their character by the choices they make every day. Or, as the new brain research would put it, they &#x201c;wire and rewire their brains&#x201d; constantly by what they choose to do and experience. Fourteen-year-old Anne Frank, before the Gestapo captured her family, put it this way in her diary: &#x201c;Parents can give good advice and put their children on the right path, but the final forming of a person&#x2019;s character lies in their own hands.&#x201d;<br><br>Our role as parents is to do the best we can. It&#x2019;s to make the most of the countless opportunities we have to contribute to our children&#x2019;s growth in character. In doing that, we need to take the long view and work to lay the best possible foundation for growth. If your children are already teens and you feel you&#x2019;ve made mistakes, have the confidence that it&#x2019;s never too late to make a fresh&nbsp;start. We can&#x2019;t change the past, but we can choose the future. Our children are a work in progress; so are we as parents.<br><br>Make a list of what you already do well as a parent and build on those strengths as well as working on what you can do better. Get support by talking with your spouse. If you&#x2019;re a single mother or father, or if your spouse is not receptive, find at least one other parent to talk to about parenting.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s look now at the challenges of trying to raise kind kids in our current, often unkind culture. In today&#x2019;s world, creating a family culture of kindness and respect will in many ways be countercultural. But it&#x2019;s still possible. It will be harder with some children than others, but we can help every child make progress onthe road to good character.<br><br><b>How to Use This Book</b><br><br>I&#x2019;d encourage you to read this book in whatever way you feel is most useful to you. The chapters follow a logical progression, but I&#x2019;ve written them so they stand alone. You can read and make use of each one without having read the one before. Take a look at the table of contents and see what interests you most&#x2014;perhaps what speaks to &#x201c;where the shoe pinches.&#x201d; If you have questions about discipline, you might want to start with chapter 7. If you&#x2019;re concerned about how to give and get respect, go straight to chapter 6. For the 10 essential virtues that make up good character and how to foster them, read chapter 5. If you want to work now on building a family culture based on kindness and respect, chapter 4 will give you 6 key strategies.

Jones to national attention. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and numerous other honors for his novel <em>The Known World</em>, Jones made his literary debut with these powerful tales of ordinary people who live in the shadows in this metropolis of great monuments and rich history. <em>Lost in the City</em> received the Pen/Hemingway Award for Best First Fiction and was a National Book Award Finalist. This beautiful 20th Anniversary Edition features a new introduction by the author, and is a wonderful companion piece to Jones&#x2019;s masterful novel and his second acclaimed collection of stories, <em>All Aunt Hagar&#x2019;s Children</em>.<br></p></p><p><p>The nation's capital that serves as the setting for the stories in Edward P. Jones's prizewinning collection, <em>Lost in the City</em>, lies far from the city of historic monuments and national politicians. Jones takes the reader beyond that world into the complicated lives of African American men, women, and even children, such as the girl set to begin elementary school in "The First Day," who work against the constant threat of loss to maintain a sense of hope. From "The Girl Who Raised Pigeons" to the well-to-do career woman awakened in the night by a phone call that will take her on a journey back to the past, the characters in these stories forge bonds of community as they struggle against the limits of their city to stave off the loss of family, friends, memories, and, ultimately, themselves.</p><p>Critically acclaimed upon publication, <em>Lost in the City</em> introduced Jones as an undeniable talent, a writer whose unaffected style is not only evocative and forceful but also filled with insight and poignancy.</p><p>Edward P. Jones, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, for fiction, the National Book Critics Circle award, the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and the Lannan Literary Award for <em>The Known World;</em> he also received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2004. His first collection of stories, <em>Lost in the City,</em> won the PEN/Hemingway Award and was short listed for the National Book Award. His second collection, <em>All Aunt Hagar&#x2019;s Children, </em>was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award. He has been an instructor of fiction writing at a range of universities, including Princeton. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p></p><h2>Hidden in Plain View: Undesigned Coincidences in the Gospels and Acts</h2><p><p><em>Hidden in Plain View: Undesigned Coincidences in the Gospels and Acts</em> revives an argument for the historical reliability of the New Testament that has been largely neglected for more than a hundred years. An undesigned coincidence is an apparently casual, yet puzzle-like &#x201c;fit&#x201d; between two or more texts, and its best explanation is that the authors knew the truth about the events they describe or allude to. Connections of this kind among passages in the Gospels, as well as between Acts and the Pauline epistles, give us reason to believe that these documents came from honest eyewitness sources, people &#x201c;in the know&#x201d; about the events they relate. Supported by careful research yet accessibly written, <em>Hidden in Plain View</em> provides solid evidence that all Christians can use to defend the Scriptures and the truth of Christianity.</p></p><p></p><h2>Deathwatch: The Omnibus</h2><p>New omnibus of novels and short stories featuring the Deathwatch, alien-hunting Space Marines who undertake special ops-style missions in the 41st millennium.<br><br>The Deathwatch are the elite.

She now shares what she learned from the guru in this life-changing narrative, and it starts with a simple emotion she calls&nbsp;Having.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suh Yoon Lee, a magnetic woman in her thirties,&nbsp;was identified as a guru at the age of six and set off on a course of study ranging from classical Asian texts to economics to an analysis of 100,000 case studies to reveal the true secrets of growing rich.&nbsp;A bestselling author and insightful thinker sought after by the richest people in the nation,&nbsp;Suh Yoon Lee retreated into seclusion, troubled by the impact her guidance to the wealthy may have on income disparity. When Jooyun wrote to the guru for an interview, Suh Yoon invited her to Lake Como, Italy. There, they started a conversation about how everyday people can achieve their financial goals more easily and quickly by living in synch with their true emotions.<br> &nbsp;<br> In destinations ranging from Paris to Kyoto, this philosophical journey lays out a framework for achieving an empowered relationship with money. The guru has found that almost everyone has the capacity to earn 3 to 7 million dollars&#x2014;and some have a capacity for much more. As Jooyun applies the guru's practical but revolutionary insights to her everyday life&#x2014;including journaling about the emotions that accompany spending money&#x2014;she experiences a transformation of her mood, fulfillment, and ultimately, her net worth. By changing your emotions about money, you can make every purchase a step toward becoming your true self.<br> &nbsp;<br> Having&nbsp;is the power that attracts wealth, and this incredible series of lessons will guide you to claim that power in your own life. Learn to feel what you already have, and you'll be able to have so much more.</p><p>SUH YOON LEE, "the guru to the rich," has analyzed both the wisdom in Asian classical texts and 100,000 case studies to discover how to become truly rich. Starting in her mid-twenties, she published books about the mindset of becoming wealthy and prominent weekly publications in Korea began seeking her out for interviews, ultimately increasing her fame as a "teacher to the wealthy."&nbsp;She has advised most of the founders and the first generations of the largest conglomerates in Korea, some of which have grown into globally renowned corporations. She has consulted with numerous owners and top executives of the top 100 companies in Korea. <br><br>JOOYUN HONG is an award-winning former journalist with 10 years of experience writing for prominent Korean publications. She also has an MBA in finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Until recently, she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company as a director of external relations.<p>1&nbsp;</p><p>The Guru&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after my father died, I celebrated my fortieth birthday. After I reached forty and suffered my father&#x2019;s death, my life seemed different. I had come from a middle-class family, studied at a top university, and worked for ten years as a journalist at one of the country&#x2019;s largest newspapers. I finished an MBA degree at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was now in charge of external relations at an American company. My life was neither extremely successful nor a great failure. I got steady pay and enough recognition from my jobs, was married to a warm-hearted man who was a public servant, and had one son. I didn&#x2019;t worry about living in poverty, but I also didn&#x2019;t live a life of ease free of financial concerns.</p><p>But I was living inflexibly. My friends with rich doctor or lawyer husbands or inheritances lived leisurely lives, but I didn&#x2019;t freely use even $10. When the newspapers were delivered, I&#x2019;d clip supermarket coupons and rush to pick up discounted meat or fish put out near closing time. I always compared the fuel prices at various gas stations while driving. When I bought things for my son, I spent hours searching the Internet for the lowest price. I couldn&#x2019;t accept buying higher-priced items. I insisted on getting refunds by sending receipts to the shopping mall or department store and would stay on the phone for hours to get them.</p><p>Although I lived frugally, my salary disappeared from my bank account. Rather than having financial stability, I was just relieved if I wasn&#x2019;t in deficit. I always felt nervous. My life had always been filled with sacrificing today for tomorrow. When would tomorrow arrive? If someone were to ask whether I wanted to keep living this way, I&#x2019;d have a very firm answer for them: No!</p><p>So after my father&#x2019;s death, I looked for the best way to get rich. I read widely, and, drawing on my background as a journalist, I visited experts to ask them for the best techniques to gain wealth, but they all gave the same answer: The stairway to becoming rich had crumbled.</p><p>&#x201c;As Thomas Piketty wrote, capital growth rate has overtaken the economic growth rate. No matter how diligent you are, you can no longer overtake people with an inheritance.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Development of artificial intelligence or robots will reduce employment. Only some capitalists will become even wealthier, and normal people will become poorer.&#x201d;</p><p>On my search, I met many young adults as well. They were also desperately seeking answers to the same question I was.</p><p>&#x201c;The older generations say their salaries must be saved for their retirement period. But I don&#x2019;t want to sacrifice my youth for the future.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After I get my salary and pay rent, repay my student loan, and pay for my living expenses, there&#x2019;s nothing left. Getting married and having children will cost even more. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be able to spend much money on myself or buy a house in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are there more people with sudden wealth even if they say it&#x2019;s becoming difficult to be rich? What&#x2019;s their secret? Will I ever become rich?&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, after facing discouragement wherever I looked, someone told me there was only one person in the world who could definitely answer my question: &#x201c;the Guru of the rich.&#x201d; Once I heard that idea, I kicked myself, because ten years earlier I had met this Guru.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of 2006, I was a journalist working as part of a newspaper&#x2019;s weekend team, looking for news items I could write about for light weekend reading. At a wine gathering with other journalists, I heard a story about &#x201c;a Guru for wealthy people&#x201d; named Suh Yoon Lee. This woman, whom every well-known rich person wanted to meet, was only in her twenties and had graduated from a prestigious university. At age six, she had already learned the classic Asian study of destiny that foresees people&#x2019;s fate based on date and time of birth, called the &#x201c;Four Pillars.&#x201d; They said she had mastered major Eastern and Asian classics and analyzed data from thousands of people to acquire her own insight. And her books about wealth all made the bestseller lists.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow! She sounds fascinating. Tell me more about this Guru,&#x201d; I exclaimed.</p><p>My colleague took a sip of wine and kept talking. &#x201c;Do you know what the most fascinating part is? Every single person who meets her feels as if they&#x2019;ve met someone different.&#x201d; I felt thirsty with curiosity upon hearing this. He said, &#x201c;Some say she resembles a wise teacher, while others say she&#x2019;s more like a witch luring people in, and others call her an innocent girl. I heard a few men succumbed to her magnetism and even worship this Guru. Of course, the Guru doesn&#x2019;t give them a chance.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. But everyone who meets her agrees on one thing. They say their lives have changed. According to them, they seized luck and opportunity and eventually got richer.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>My gut told me that this could be a great story. I desperately wanted to meet her and figure out what kind of person she was. Just hearing the story made me think it would be a big hit with readers. I made a call to get an appointment.</p><p>On the day of the interview, I was waiting for her in the lobby of a building. Sure enough, someone soon entered through a large glass door. There are some moments in life that you can remember as if they happened yesterday, with vivid memories of the atmosphere, air, and sound. I&#x2019;ll never forget the first moment I saw Suh Yoon.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t see her face clearly at first, but I could recognize at a glance that she was the Guru. The entire atmosphere around her was different, even mystical, as if shrouded by an early-morning fog. That was the first and only time I&#x2019;ve felt that way about anyone. Subconsciously nervous, I stood rooted to the spot as if turned to stone.&nbsp;</p><p>Suh Yoon came up to me and offered her hand for a handshake. Her hand startled me--it was fragile enough to awaken a protective instinct in me.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You must be Ms. Hong. Nice to meet you.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>I began speaking hesitantly. &#x201c;Oh . . . hello . . . How should I address you . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can just call me by my first name.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a sweet and musical quality to her voice. Her posture was elegant and dignified, and she had unusually skinny arms and legs on a willowy frame. She had a milky, round face and a chiseled nose, and her almond-shaped eyes twinkled as she smiled. Although she wasn&#x2019;t a typical beauty, her appearance was bewitching. She was in her late twenties but appeared much younger, apart from her eyes, which were piercing.</p><p>The interview that day felt like magic. I was lost in my conversation with Suh Yoon and barely noticed anything else around me. Suh Yoon astonished me with her insight. She led the conversation, making every word count, and offered wise answers and mild consolation in words that were easy to understand.</p><p>While wrapping up our conversation, I asked, &#x201c;What are your future plans?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve accumulated cases of rich people around the world and I&#x2019;m analyzing the correlation between wealth and attitude based on that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, that sounds fascinating. That analysis could reveal the secret to becoming rich!&#x201d;</p><p>Suh Yoon gently held my hand and said, &#x201c;You may not realize it yet, Ms. Hong, but you are still trapped in a cage. If you decide to free yourself from that cage, within ten years, we will be reunited.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t understand what her words meant, so I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to them. But now, ten years later, her mention of reunion rang vividly in my ears like music.</p><p>Where would she be now? Would she even remember what she told me?</p></p><h2>Gregory Heisler: 50 Portraits: Stories and Techniques from a Photographer&#39;s Photographer</h2><p>In this first-ever showcase of his work, Gregory Heisler, one of professional photography's most respected practitioners, shares 50 iconic portraits of celebrities, athletes, and world leaders, along with fascinating, thoughtful, often humorous stories about how the images were made.

(45-135 kg); F 75-200 lb. (34-90 kg) </p><p><b>Description:</b> Reddish brown during summer, grayish brown during winter. Large ears, white inside with black edges. A white eye-ring, nose band, chin, throat and belly. Brown tail with a black tip and white underside. Male has antlers with many tines and an antler spread of 12-36" (30-90 cm). Female has a thinner neck than male and lacks antlers. </p><p><b>Origin/Age:</b> native; 5-10 years </p><p><b>Compare:</b> Slightly smaller size than the much less common Mule Deer (pg. 269), which has a small thin white tail with a black tip. </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> all habitats </p><p><b>Home:</b> no den or nest; sleeps in a different spot every night, beds may be concentrated in one area, does not use a shelter in bad weather or winter, will move to a semi-sheltered area (yard) with a good food supply in winter </p><p><b>Food:</b> herbivore; grasses and other green plants, acorns and nuts in summer, twigs and buds in winter </p><p><b>Sounds:</b> loud whistle-like snorts, male grunts, fawn bleats </p><p><b>Breeding</b> late Oct-Nov mating; 6-7 months gestation </p><p><b>Young:</b> 1-2 fawns once per year in May or June; covered with white spots, walks within hours of birth </p><p><b>Signs:</b> browsed twigs that are ripped or torn (due to the lack of upper incisor teeth), tree rubs (saplings scraped or stripped of bark) made by male while polishing antlers during the rut, oval depressions in snow or leaves are evidence of beds; round, hard brown pellets during winter, cylindrical segmented masses of scat in spring and summer </p><p><b>Activity:</b> nocturnal, crepuscular; often moves along same trails to visit feeding areas, moves around less when snow is deep </p><p><b>Tracks:</b> front hoof 2-3" (5-7.5 cm) long, hind hoof slightly smaller, both with a split heart shape with a point in the front; neat line of single tracks; hind hooves fall near or directly onto fore prints (direct register) when walking </p><p><b>Stan&#x2019;s Notes:</b> This deer is the most common large mammal in Minnesota and has the most widespread range. Originally not found throughout the state, its range expanded dramatically in the mid- to late 1800s due to logging and overhunting of native elk and caribou. Now found in nearly every habitat in every part of Minnesota. Also known as Virginia Deer or Whitetail. </p><p>Much longer guard hairs in winter give the animal a larger appearance than in summer. Individual hairs of the winter coat are thick and hollow and provide excellent insulation. Falling snow often does not melt on its back. </p><p>In summer, antlers are covered with a furry skin called velvet. Velvet contains a network of blood vessels that supplies nutrients to the growing antlers. New antler growth begins after the male (buck) drops his antlers in January or February. Some females (does) have been known to grow antlers. </p><p>Deer are dependent on the location of the food supply. In winter large groups move to low moist areas (yards) that have plenty of white cedar trees. This yarding behavior helps keep trails open and provides some protection from predators. Eats 5-9 pounds (2.3-4.1 kg) of food per day, preferring acorns in fall and fresh grass in spring. Its four-chambered stomach enables the animal to get nutrients from poor food sources such as twigs and eat and drink substances that are unsuitable for humans. </p><p>Able to run up to 37 miles (60 km) per hour, jump up to 8 1&#x2044;2 feet (2.6 m) high and leap 30 feet (9.1 m). Also an excellent swimmer. </p><p>The buck is solitary in spring and early summer, but seeks other bucks in late summer and early fall to spar. Bucks are polygamous. The largest, most dominant bucks mate with many does. </p><p>For a couple weeks after birth, fawns lay still all day while their mother is away feeding. Mother nurses them evenings and nights.</p></p><h2>Emily</h2><p><b>From Michael Bedard and two-time Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Barbara Cooney comes a story<b>&nbsp;</b>about American poet Emily Dickinson and the young girl who befriends her.<br></b><br>What if your neighbor were the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson?

But Jeffrey J. Fox, the founder of a marketing consulting company, also gives these tips: never write a nasty memo, skip all office parties, and overpay your people. These are a few of his key ways to climb the corporate ladder.</p><p>Most books about career advancement are either weighty examinations about success in the workplace (e.g., <i>How to Be a Star at Work</i> and <i>Working with Emotional Intelligence)</i> or flippant, humorous takes on surviving the countless inanities of modern work life (e.g., <i>Working Wounded</i>). Jeffrey Fox's book, <i>How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization</i> is neither. Instead, Fox presents 75 commonsense rules about successfully conducting your career.<p> Rules like "Know Everybody by Their First Name" and "No Goals No Glory" may seem obvious; others, such as "Don't Take Work Home from the Office" or "Don't Have a Drink with the Gang" may not. Each is accompanied by page or two of succinct and thought-provoking explanation. For example, for rule 27, "Don't Hide an Elephant," Fox writes, "Big problems always surface. If they have been hidden, even unintentionally, the negative fallout is always worse. The 'hiders' always get burned, regardless of complicity. The 'discoverers' always are safe, regardless of complicity." Wise and to the point, <i>How to Become CEO</i> will help just about anybody's career, whether you want to become CEO or not. <i>--Harry C.

After all, even fluent English speakers can be at sixes and sevens when told to pick up the "dog and bone" or "head to the loo," so they can "spend a penny." Wherever did these peculiar expressions come from?<br>&nbsp;<br>British author Christopher J. Moore made a name for himself on this side of the pond with the sleeper success of his previous book, <i>In Other Words</i>. Now, Moore draws on history, literature, pop culture, and his own heritage to explore the phrases that most embody the British character. He traces the linguistic influence of writers from Chaucer to Shakespeare and Dickens to Wodehouse, and unravels the complexity Brits manage to imbue in seemingly innocuous phrases like "All right."&nbsp;Along the way, Moore reveals the uniquely British origins of some of the English language&#x2019;s more curious sayings. For example: Who is Bob and how did he become your uncle? Why do we refer to powerless politicians as &#x201c;lame ducks&#x201d;? How did &#x201c;posh&#x201d; become such a stylish word?<br><br>Part language guide, part cultural study, <i>How to Speak Brit</i> is the perfect addition to every Anglophile&#x2019;s library and an entertaining primer that will charm the linguistic-minded legions.</p><p><b>Christopher J. Moore</b> is an author and editor. He splits his time among Scotland, Spain, and the Swiss Alps.<p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>There is something that has to be understood straightaway about the British: As soon as you open your mouth, your listener puts you into a social category. &#x201c;Language most shewes a man: speake that I may see thee,&#x201d; wrote the playwright Ben Jonson as early as 1641 to point out that your life could literally depend on the way you spoke. The principle of respecting the King&#x2019;s English was already well established by the mid-seventeenth century and we have to go back some two-hundred years further to find where it all started. </p><p>In the Middle Ages, Latin and French had been the languages of government and diplomacy, but during the Renaissance the change to vernacular languages was happening all over Europe, and England was no exception. As yet, English had little or no standard spelling and existed in a thousand different varieties and dialects. Only around the start of the fifteenth century did a standard form of English begin to be adopted for government business in London, thus establishing a court English as opposed to a <i>country</i> English. When William Caxton set up his printing press later that century, this was the standard he adopted, initiating an industry so successful that here we are, still at it, making books.</p><p>As for the actual expression, &#x201c;the King&#x2019;s English,&#x201d; Thomas Wilson appears to have been the first to use it in his <i>Art of Rhetorique</i> of 1553, where he takes to task the pretensions of those who infect the English language with fancy foreign borrowings, or what he calls &#x201c;strange inkhorn terms.&#x201d; Wilson was so irritated with what he saw as a departure from plain speech that he wrote, &#x201c;they forget altogether their mother&#x2019;s language. And I dare swear this, if some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to tell what they say, and yet these fine English clerks will say they speak in their mother tongue, if a man should charge them for counterfeiting the King&#x2019;s English.&#x201d;</p><p>Over the next three centuries, many other writers pursued the same ideal, driven by their annoyance with lax standards to publish guides and norms for good writing and speaking. Educationalists followed suit, with the newly founded grammar schools teaching good practice. </p><p>Language was increasingly the key that opened the door to elegant society, employment, and advancement. Lessons in elocution&#x2014;the art of speaking properly&#x2014;became a necessary part of the education of any young lady, especially those, like Jane Austen&#x2019;s heroines, in search of a husband with estates and an income of more than three thousand a year.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous example in literature of the social power of <i>received</i> English is found in George Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s 1916 play <i>Pygmalion</i>, popularized in the 1960s stage musical and movie <i>My Fair Lady</i>. Here, Shaw complained bitterly, &#x201c;It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him.&#x201d;</p><p>To give a flavor of Shaw&#x2019;s irritation, we need only turn to the opening scene of the play where Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl, encounters the mother of a young man who asks her how the girl knows her son:</p><p><i>ELIZA. Ow, eez ye-ooa san, is e? Wal, fewd dan y&#x2019; de-ooty bawmz a mather should, eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel&#x2019;s flahrzn than ran awy athaht pyin. Will ye-oo py me f&#x2019;them? [Shaw&#x2019;s note: Here, with apologies, this desperate attempt to represent her dialect without a phonetic alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside London.]</i></p><p>Eliza, painfully aware of her dreadful Cockney accent, goes to see Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics, to ask him for elocution lessons. The professor, spurred on by a bet with a friend, takes on the challenge of changing the flower girl&#x2019;s speech and manners to make her acceptable to upper-class London society. In the end, like the sculptor Pygmalion in the classical myth, he falls in love with his own successful creation.</p><p>However, we are in another world now. From the 1940s onwards, new linguistic theories emerged, banishing the insistence on<i> correctness </i>that our elders used to teach us. From then on, all varieties of language became new hunting grounds, and linguists raced about cataloging dialects and tongues, the rarer and more threatened the better. In the remotest corners of Britain, modest and retiring grannies were surprised to find microphones thrust under their noses, with the invitation to sing, chant, or narrate anything that came into their heads.</p><p>Society and education moved rapidly with this change in attitude. Added to the new linguistic freedoms was that of ignorance, as grammar was no longer taught in schools, and no British person under the age of forty now has any idea what a substantive, preposition, or adverb is, let alone the correct use of the apostrophe. </p><p>The BBC, slow to change but quick to keep up its listening audience figures, showed how to move with the times in broadcasting. Local radio DJs were recruited off the street, or from pirate radio stations, with their local accents, jokes, and rapid-fire wit. Accents became the new cachet, attractively packaged to represent real, live people rather than social constructs. Among the shifts in perception, a national bank discovered that its telephone clients seemed to trust a Scottish accent more than any other, and so it was to be.</p><p>Linguists gave us the freedom to speak as we like, and as a result, perhaps at no time since the first Elizabethan period, when Shakespeare took full advantage of it, has the language been in such a state of rapid and creative change. The sheer inventiveness of English is what captures the imagination.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It&#x2019;s a Dog&#x2019;s Life</p><p>The comforts of hearth and home are central to the British sense of well-being. A cozy, private home with a roaring fire to keep the gloomy weather at bay, a pipe and slippers, and a cherished dog snoozing at your feet&#x2014;all of these are parts of the British psyche that run deep. Home may be a magnificent <b>manor</b>, a modest <b>semi-detached</b>, or a clapped out caravan, but for a Brit, there&#x2019;s simply no better place to be. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Aga (noun)</p><p><i>A heavy duty, cast-iron stove cherished by middle-class Brits as a symbol of home and its comforts. </i></p><p>An Aga is a rather unusual and extremely expensive kind of domestic stove, which has become an iconic piece of equipment for a certain type of British household. The Aga&#x2019;s inventor, Gustaf Dal�n (1869&#x2013;1937), was a blind, 1912 Nobel Laureate for Physics. Wanting a stove without knobs and controls and that didn&#x2019;t require constant tending, Dal�n went about designing a self-regulating version for his own kitchen. </p><p>Agas, despite being somewhat clunky in appearance, are surprisingly fuel-efficient and capable of running for twenty-four hours on only eight pounds of solid fuel while producing an intense and lasting radiant heat.</p><p>Now over eighty years old, the Aga has come under British ownership and, with its enthusiastic adoption by middle-class households, has acquired an essentially British character. It has even inspired a modern genre of novels known as <i>Aga-Sagas </i>(typified by the work of the writer Joanna Trollope) that explore the Home Counties (the counties in the south and southeast of England that directly surround London) existence of middle-class families, their domestic life, passions, and temptations.</p><p>Yet none of this tells you what exactly the appeal of an Aga is, why owners fall hopelessly in love with them, nor why their Aga appears to represent for them an ideal of home comfort and convenience. You will just have to find someone who owns one, and ask them. Make sure you allow plenty of time for the long, detailed, and enthusiastic reply.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Bloomsbury (proper noun)</p><p><i>A faded, yet elegant, area in central London near the British Museum, known as the home for scandalous behavior by the literary and artistic set in the early twentieth century. </i></p><p>Once characterized by Georgian period squares, and known for its bookshops, publishing houses, and social elegance, Bloomsbury was devastated by German bombs during the Second World War. </p><p>In the 1970s, London University and its construction of charmless, concrete buildings left the area a pale shadow of what it once was.</p><p>Yet echoes of a more elegant, if risqu�, past are still present. The so-called Bloomsbury Group in London had something of the same notoriety as the literary and artistic Americans who congregated in Paris around the 1920s and scandalized everyone with their unconventional lifestyles. Future publisher Leonard Woolf, while an undergraduate at Cambridge, had already established relationships with an elite group of young intellectuals known as the<i> Apostles</i>. Later, with his wife, novelist Virginia Woolf, he maintained a close-knit circle of like-minded thinkers and artists, centered on Gordon Square where Virginia lived.</p><p>The inner circle included artists Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell; critics Lytton Strachey, Roger Fry, and Clive Bell; as well as the economist John Maynard Keynes, though many others dropped in to share in the avant-garde buzz surrounding the group, given the added attraction of their effortlessly superior social standing. But the elitist ambience of the group, their progressive politics, and their disregard for convention&#x2014; especially in personal and sexual relationships&#x2014;left room for much criticism, leading to the famous comment that the group did little more than &#x201c;live in squares and love in triangles.&#x201d;</p><p>The outcome of so much intensity and striving for a new social order was not always happiness. Virginia Woolf, after many years of mental instability, and against the background of her long-lasting love affair with the blue-blooded Vita Sackville-West, committed suicide in 1941.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chelsea (proper noun)</p><p><i>An affluent area in London that is home to the annual Chelsea Flower Show. </i></p><p>The annual Chelsea Flower Show is reputed to be the greatest flower show on earth. It is a major event for all those men and women who have spent the entire year <b>pottering</b> (and probably potting, too) and who come out by the thousands to see how the professional garden designers fare in competition against each other. Why the general public subjects itself to this experience of acute envy is not exactly clear.</p><p>Most amateur gardeners spend a great deal of time battling against the unexpected and the unwilling&#x2014;weather, plants, neighbors, and spouses. But if there is one consolation found in coming to Chelsea, it seems that the professionals have precisely the same problems: Plants fail to thrive, water features dry up or overflow, neighbors complain, workmen don&#x2019;t turn up on time, and trellises collapse in the wind. And still, in the end, the results can be marvelous.</p><p>Yet a word of cautionary wisdom. The writer Rudyard Kipling produced what may be the best practical comment on gardening in literature in a brief verse that goes:</p><p><i>Our England is a garden,</i></p><p><i>and such gardens are not made</i></p><p><i>by sighing, &#x201c;Oh, how beautiful!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>and sitting in the shade.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>(The) Continent (noun) </p><p><i>An affectionate, if slightly patronizing, expression to describe where non-Brits in Europe live. </i></p><p>The British are very conscious of being an island nation. On the Continent, that is, the other side of the English Channel, is where everyone else in Europe lives. There was, reportedly, a famous London newspaper headline which read, &#x201c;Fog in Channel. Continent cut off.&#x201d; </p><p>In earlier centuries, it was considered an essential element of a young person&#x2019;s proper education to do the <i>Grand Tour</i> of European cities, learning something of our neighbors&#x2019; artistic and cultural achievements in the process. Many British travelers fell in love with these places. Some never came back. But for most, the experience was somewhat mixed and dangerously unhealthy. The strange food, the doubtful purity of the water, the casual approach to life&#x2019;s little intimacies, were far too unfamiliar and uncomfortable, even life-threatening, for those of a delicate temperament. For such unsteady souls, the White Cliffs of Dover were a truly beloved sight on the return home.</p><p>For these reasons, it could be said that the moment you first stepped off a plane or boat and onto the Continent used to be a turning point in a British person&#x2019;s life. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Coventry, send someone to (expression) </p><p><i>To ostracize, ignore, shun, or treat as a pariah.</i></p><p>Coventry is a businesslike town in the Midlands (the area that separates the north of England from the south) that appears to have never done anyone any harm, yet the saying implies otherwise. Like so many sayings that enter popular language, this one has an uncertain origin. It may have its roots in the seventeenth century when, during the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians, any soldiers of King Charles I that were captured in the battles around the Midlands were literally sent to Coventry, a town that was loyal to Parliament. The people of Coventry were not very welcoming to these enemies and tended to ignore the disgraced soldiers, refusing to serve them in taverns or inns so they were largely reduced to begging in the streets. To be sent to Coventry, then, may have served as a threat hanging over Royalist soldiers so that they fought all the harder to avoid capture.</p><p>Unfortunately, the threat didn&#x2019;t have the required effect. The Parliamentarians subsequently defeated and deposed the forces of King Charles I and, in 1649, in an act that sent shockwaves around the royal courts of Europe, cut off his head. Many thought we had reached, in today&#x2019;s phrase, <i>the end of monarchy</i>, but it was not to be.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Dickensian (adjective)</p><p><i>Gloomy, squalid. </i></p><p>The Victorian novelist Charles Dickens (1812&#x2013;70) wrote compelling works filled with vivid details of the difficult social conditions in the London of his day. The accounts in his novels of the appalling fate of the poor and the squalid conditions in prisons and poorhouses attracted much attention and increased public awareness of the terrible suffering endured by the lowest classes of society. The term <i>Dickensian</i> is still used to describe acute conditions of poverty or deprivation wherever they may be found in Britain.</p><p></p><p></p><p>DIY (noun phrase)</p><p><i>An abbreviation of the phrase Do-It-Yourself, referring to the maintenance, building, and repairs of the home by the homeowner, often left unfinished. </i></p><p></p></p><h2>The Art of Healing: Uncovering Your Inner Wisdom and Potential for Self-Healing</h2><p>In these pages, renowned medical doctor and spiritual teacher Bernie Siegel demonstrates how science and spirituality interact &#x2014; and how you can tap your body&#x2019;s potential to heal.

Sensitive, whimsical, possessed of an extraordinary and powerful imagination, she spends hours writing haiku, reading Shakespeare, or simply hiding in the dark warmth of the airing cupboard. As the child of an English father and a Nigerian mother, Jess just can't shake off the feeling of being alone wherever she goes, and the other kids in her class are wary of her tendency to succumb to terrified fits of screaming. Believing that a change from her English environment might be the perfect antidote to Jess's alarming mood swings, her parents whisk her off to Nigeria for the first time where she meets her mother's family--including her formidable grandfather. <br>Jess's adjustment to Nigeria is only beginning when she encounters Titiola, or TillyTilly, a ragged little girl her own age.

Serious yoga students want to bring the wisdom of the Sutras to their practice but often find the text impenetrable and difficult to relate to. Here, yogi and Tantric master Alan Finger offers an interpretation of the Sutras that is clear and immediately relevant&#x2014;and he shows contemporary practitioners that samadhi is something that they can experience here and now. <br><br> Yoga is a process of spiritual evolution, and samadhi is as natural as breathing and available to all, because it is our true nature. Viewed through a Tantric framework, Finger shows us how the Sutras describe the yogic process that both leads us to the experience of samadhi and allows us to weave the wisdom and grace of that experience back into our everyday life.</p><p>Alan Finger was born and raised in South Africa and was a student of Paramahansa Yogananda, Krishnamacharya, and B. K. S. Iyengar, among others. He is the founder of ISHTA Yoga, a style of yoga that blends the ancient and contemporary sciences of Hatha, Tantra, and Ayurveda into a complete and comprehensive system of self-development.

Regarded as one of the key disciplines in fostering the focused, meditative state of mind so essential to Zen, <i>shodo</i> calligraphy is practiced regularly by all students of Zen Buddhism in Japan. After providing a brief history of Japanese calligraphy and its close relationship with the teachings of Zen Buddhism, Sato explains the necessary supplies and fundamental brushstroke skills that you'll need. He goes on to present thirty <i>zengo</i>, each featuring:<br><ul><li>An example by a skilled Zen monk or master calligrapher</li><li>An explanation of the individual characters and the Zen koan as a whole</li><li>Step-by-step instructions on how to paint the phrase in a number of styles (Kaisho, Gyosho, Sosho)</li></ul>A stunning volume on the intersection of Japanese aesthetics and Zen Buddhist thought, <i>Shodo: The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy</i> guides both beginning and advanced students to a deeper understanding of the unique brush painting art form of <i>shodo</i> calligraphy. <br><br><b>Shodo calligraphy topics include:</b><ul><li> The Art of Kanji</li><li> The Four Treasures of Shodo</li><li> Ideogram Zengo</li><li> Students of Shodo</li></ul></p><p><b>Shozo Sato</b> is a master of traditional Zen arts, and has received the Order of Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan for his contributions in teaching Japanese traditions. <i>His areas of expertise include</i> ikebana (flower arranging), chanoyu (tea ceremony), and Japanese theater as well as sumi-e (ink painting). He conducts workshops on ikebana and sumi-e throughout the U.S., Asia and Europe and is the author of numerous books including <i>Tea Ceremony, Shodo: The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy</i> and <i>The Art of Sumi-e</i>. He was the founding director of Japan House at the University of Illinois, where he is Professor Emeritus and continues to teach Japanese arts. Shozo Sato resides in Champaign, IL."This book is a gift for the mind and the eyes. Thoughtful commentary provokes an ongoing consideration of the meanings of the Zen phrases, while the brilliant inclusion of calligraphic how-to educates the eyes on how to follow the lines of ink in the original free-flowing gestures of the brush. I know I will return to this book again and again." &#x2014;<b>Christy A. Bartlett, Director, Urasenke Foundation San Francisco</b><br><br>"When complimented by an understanding of the literal, poetic, and philosophical meaning of the words, looking at Japanese calligraphy can be an exciting aesthetic and intellectual experience. It is with this goal in mind, of unlocking meaning and relevance to the non-Japanese speaker, that Shozo Sato presents his latest publication <i>Shodo: The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy</i>." &#x2014;<b>Deborah Clearwaters, Director of Education and Interpretation, Asian Art Museum San Francisco</b><br><br>"Both Zen Buddhism and the art of calligraphy can seem impenetrable to newcomers. Even the nuances of how to hold a brush can form an insurmountable obstacle without proper training. However, Shozo Sato's <i>Shodo, The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy</i> synthesizes these challenging fields into an easily digestible and visually stunning volume...<i>Shodo</i> is a perfect coffee table book for those wanting to learn more about calligraphy, and dip their brushes into the world Zen." <b>&#x2014; <i>Kyoto Journal</i></b><br><br>"More than a primer on shodo, this book gives a thorough discussion of the practice of calligraphy as well as insight into the mindset and understanding required for writing zengo. Therefore, it should be seen as fitting into a long line of excellent publications that bring the often baffling teachings of Zen to a wide English-speaking audience." &#x2014;<b>Janice Katz, Ph.

Long before television beamed daily images of combat into our living rooms, Pyle&#x2019;s on-the-spot reporting gave the American public a firsthand view of what war was like for the boys on the front. Pyle followed the soldiers into the trenches, battlefields, field hospitals, and beleaguered cities of Europe. What he witnessed he described with a clarity, sympathy, and grit that gave the public back home an immediate sense of the foot soldier&#x2019;s experience.&nbsp;There were really two wars, John Steinbeck wrote in <i>Time</i> magazine: one of maps and logistics, campaigns, ballistics, divisions, and regiments and the other a "war of the homesick, weary, funny, violent, common men who wash their socks in their helmets, complain about the food, whistle at Arab girls, or any girls for that matter, and bring themselves through as dirty a business as the world has ever seen and do it with humor and dignity and courage&#x2014;and that is Ernie Pyle&#x2019;s war." This collection of Pyle&#x2019;s columns detailing the fighting in Europe in 1943&#x2013;44 brings that war&#x2014;and the living, and dying, moments of history&#x2014;home to us once again.</p><p>Ernie Pyle worked as managing editor of the <i>Washington News</i> and later became a roving journalist for Scripps Howard Newspapers. After many years following the fighting in Europe, Pyle traveled to the South Pacific, where a sniper's bullet took his life in 1945. G. Kurt Piehler is an assistant professor of history at the University of Tennessee and the author of <i>Remembering War the American Way.</i>"<i>Brave Men</i> is a collection of journalist Pyle's newspaper columns from 1943 and 1944, in which he details the fighting in Europe primarily from the perspective of the common U.S. G.I. This angle of reporting brought the front-line war back to the families of those serving in the armed forces and endeared Pyle to the troops. An essential piece of Americana for all collections."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"In his fine introduction to this new edition, G. Kurt Piehler (History/Univ. of Tennessee at Knoxville) celebrates Pyle's 'dense, descriptive style' and his unusual feel for the quotidian GI experience&#x2014;a personal and human side to war left out of reporting on generals and their strategies. . . . <i>Kirkus</i>, at the time [of the original edition in 1944], noted the hoopla over Pyle (Pulitzer, hugely popular syndicated column, BOMC hype) and decided it was all worth it: 'the book doesn't let the reader down.' Pyle, of course, captures 'the human qualities' of men in combat, but he also provides 'an extraordinary sense of the scope of the European war fronts, the variety of services involved, the men and their officers.' . . .

Not to mention the vacations that had to be planned around the harvest, the near electrocution of the tree man, the limitations of his own middle-aged body, and the pity of his wife and kids. When Alexander runs (just for fun!) a costbenefit analysis, adding up everything from the live animal trap to the Velcro tomato wraps and then amortizing it over the life of his garden, it comes as quite a shock to learn that it cost him a staggering $64 to grow each one of his beloved Brandywine tomatoes. But as any gardener will tell you, you can&#39;t put a price on the unparalleled pleasures of providing fresh food for your family.</p><p>Who knew that Bill Alexander's simple dream of having a vegetable garden and small orchard would lead him into life-and-death battles with webworms, weeds, and a groundhog named Superchuck? Over the course of his hilarious adventures, Alexander puzzles over why a six-thousand-volt wire doesn't deter deer but nearly kills his tree surgeon; encounters a gardener who bears an eerie resemblance to Christopher Walken; and stumbles across the aphrodisiac effects of pollen when he plays bumble bee to his apple blossoms.<br><br> When he decides (just for fun) to calculate how much it cost to grow one of his beloved Brandywine tomatoes, he comes up with a staggering $64. But as any gardener knows, you can't put a price tag on the rewards of homegrown produce, or on the lessons learned along the way.<p>William Alexander, the author of two critically acclaimed books, lives in New York's Hudson Valley. By day the IT director at a research institute, he made his professional writing debut at the age of fifty-three with a national bestseller about gardening, <i>The $64 Tomato.</i> His second book, <i>52 Loaves,</i> chronicled his quest to bake the perfect loaf of bread, a journey that took him to such far-flung places as a communal oven in Morocco and an abbey in France, as well as into his own backyard to grow, thresh, and winnow wheat. The <i>Boston Globe</i> called Alexander "wildly entertaining," the <i>New York Times</i> raved that "his timing and his delivery are flawless," and the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> observed that "the world would be a less interesting place without the William Alexanders who walk among us." A 2006 Quill Book Awards finalist, Alexander won a Bert Greene Award from the IACP for his article on bread, published in <i>Saveur</i> magazine. A passion bordering on obsession unifies all his writing. He has appeared on NPR's <i>Morning Edition</i> and at the National Book Festival in Washington DC and is a frequent contributor to the<i> New York Times</i> op-ed pages, where he has opined on such issues as the Christmas tree threatening to ignite his living room and the difficulties of being organic. Now, in <i>Flirting with French,</i> he turns his considerable writing talents to his perhaps less considerable skills: becoming fluent in the beautiful but maddeningly illogical French language.&nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Against the Stream: A Buddhist Manual for Spiritual Revolutionaries</h2><p><p> Buddha was a revolutionary. His practice was subversive; his message, seditious. His enlightened point of view went against the norms of his day&#x2014;in his words, "against the stream." His teachings changed the world, and now they can change you too. </p> <p> Presenting the basics of Buddhism with personal anecdotes, exercises, and guided meditations, bestselling author Noah Levine guides the reader along a spiritual path that has led to freedom from suffering and has saved lives for 2,500 years. Levine should know. Buddhist meditation saved him from a life of addiction and crime. He went on to counsel and teach countless others the Buddhist way to freedom, and here he shares those life-changing lessons with you. Read and awaken to a new and better life. </p></p><p><p>Noah Levine, M.A., has been using Buddhist practices to recover from addiction since 1988. He is the founding teacher of Against the Stream Buddhist Meditation Society.</p>Levine's first book, <i>Dharma Punx</i>, was the autobiography of a young hell-raiser. Having escaped juvenile hall and drug addiction through the slow discipline of Buddhist practices, the son of Buddhist author Stephen Levine is now a spiritual teacher. In this book he presents what he has learned about and through Buddhism. The compelling personal narrative may be gone, but the disarming, frank tone that made the first book persuasive remains. He writes about the challenge of celibacy, for example, a different kind of difficulty than that posed by intimate relationships. Levine has taken the Buddha's teachings to heart&#x2014;he would call it heart-mind&#x2014;and clearly returns to such central ideas as impermanence and suffering, giving his thinking simplicity and consistency. Considering there's a lot of Buddhism here, the book is free of a lot of Buddhist-speak. An appendix includes to-the-point instructions for a variety of meditations that relate to essential Buddhist qualities and ideas. Levine's no-frills approach makes this a short book that will be accessible for young adults with little or no experience of Buddhism. Whether the book is about a revolutionary way of life is arguable, but it is an honest book&#x2014;what Buddhists would call right speech&#x2014;driven by right intention. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Believers will uncover the enemy s deceptive plan to use their own words against them and what they can do to turn their situation around. </p><p> 'One of the best things that ever happened to me, my family, and my church, was the revelation of the law of confession - we learned that the moment we win the battle over our words, we win the battle!'<br> Dr. Bill Winston </p><p> Controlling your words is one of the biggest challenges anyone will face in this life; the Bible reveals that the power of life and death are in the words you say.

Although the disciples had denied and abandoned the Crucified One, they came to realize, through the reading of Scriptures and the breaking of bread, that Jesus had given himself up for the life of the world, so transforming death into life, darkness into light, and flesh into word.<br><br>Beginning with the Passion narratives, Fr Behr examines how we search the scriptures to encounter Christ and thereby realize that we were created for this encounter, thus opening a profound perspective on creation, the fall, sin, and salvation history. He further explains how Christ is born in those who are born again in the Church, their "Virgin Mother," so that they become truly human, after the stature of Christ, and continue the incarnation of the Word by glorifying God in their bodies.<br><br>By returning to the approach of the early Church, this fresh study by a renowned patristic scholar offers a way out of the problems that have beset theology and scriptural study in recent centuries.<br><br>"A Christian's first concern is for truth. The Mystery of Christ provides astounding insights into thetruth, indeed the many truths, of and about God's gospel in his Son Jesus, the crucified Lord."<br><br>-Protopresbyter Thomas Hopko, Dean Emeritus, St Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary.<br><br>"This magnificently conceived, tightly presented and argued introduction to Christian theology is brilliant...I haven't enough superlatives to do it justice."<br><br>-Rev.

Why, trick him, of course...and and trick him again...and trick him one more time! Here&#39;s a lively retelling of a Mexican folk tale by master story teller Verna Aardema, illustrated in bold, winning colors by Petra Mathers.</p><p>* Verna Aardema grew up in New Era, Michigan as the third in a family of nine children.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cedar swamp in the back of her house served as her inspiration and retreat as a young aspiring writer.<br> <br>* At Michigan State College, Verna took many writing courses, but none that were aimed at writing for children.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't think about the children's book field until many years later, when she had to make up stories to get her baby daughter to eat.<br> <br>* Verna writes mostly African folktales because of her fascination with that infinitely diverse continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of its jungles, deserts, and great plains have come some of the most unusual and charming folktales in the world.<br> <br>* As of today, Verna has published over 25 books and is still working on more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her books have been translated into French, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese and Afrikaans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>* Verna lives in North Fort Myers, Florida, with her husband, Albert.&nbsp;&nbsp;This trickster tale pits a gullible coyote against a deceptively cute lamb.

Times were tough, money was scarce and the bills, frustrations, and fears were piled high.

Practical and inspiring, the short essays shed light on living with a miracle and the afterlife, each ending with a relevant scripture. Listen in as Todd, and for the first time ever Sonja, from her perspective as a mom, show you how believing heaven is for real helps us survive hardships here on earth, including the death of a loved one or the loss of a child through tragedy, miscarriage, or even abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>This newly revised edition offers bonus material including:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>New&nbsp;foreword</li><li>Never-before-seen family photos</li><li>Favorite scenes from the movie</li><li>Q&amp;A section&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Come see how heaven can indeed touch earth and change everything.</p></p><p><p>Todd Burpo is pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan and a volunteer fireman.

To these fascinating issues Margaret Atwood brings a candid appraisal of her own experience as well as a breadth of reading that encompasses everything from Dante to Elmore Leonard. An ambitious artistic inquiry conducted with unpretentious charm, <i>Negotiating with the Dead </i>is an invaluable insider&#x2019;s view of the writer&#x2019;s universe.</p><p>After having been through the "wash-and-spin cycle" a few times, Margaret Atwood realized that her "own experience in the suds may be relevant to others." Thus was born <i>Negotiating with the Dead</i>, six essays about what it means to be a writer, particularly a female writer. Each essay explores one aspect of writerly contemplation: art vs. commerce; the ideal reader; the separation between the part of a person that writes and the part that lives; and, as the title suggests, the constant presence of those who came before (both writers and other ancestors). Atwood relates her own experiences as a female poet (to be taken seriously, it would have helped to commit suicide) and as a bestselling novelist (whether your books are good or bad, sell well or don't, people will look down at you for it). These are intriguing meditations, with references to works by Virgil, Isak Dinesen, Robertson Davies, and countless others (Atwood's own dead, no doubt). <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>What is the role of the writer? Prophet? High Priest of Art? Court Jester? Or witness to the real world? Margaret Atwood examines the metaphors which writers of fiction and poetry have used to explain--or excuse!--their activities. If a writer is to be seen as gifted, who is doing the giving and what are the terms of the gift? Atwood&#39;s lightness of touch is underlined by a seriousness about writing, and by a deep familiarity with the myths and traditions of western literature.</p><h2>Quietly Courageous: Leading the Church in a Changing World</h2><p>The changing dynamics of contemporary church life are well-known, but what&#x2019;s less well-known is how leaders can work most effectively in this new context. In Quietly Courageous, esteemed minister and congregational consultant Gil Rendle offers practical guidance to leaders&#x2014;both lay and ordained&#x2014;on leading churches today. Rendle encourages leaders to stop focusing on the past and instead focus relentlessly on their mission and purpose&#x2014;what is ultimately motivating their work. He also urges a shift in perspectives on resources, discusses models of change, and offers suggestions for avoiding common pitfalls and working creatively today.</p><p>Gil Rendle is former senior vice president for the Texas Methodist Foundation as well as former senior consultant and director of consulting for the Alban Institute. As an ordained minister with a PhD in organizational and group dynamics, he has worked with congregations across denominations for more than thirty years. He is the author of a number of books, including Holy Conversations: Strategic Planning as Spiritual Practice for Congregations.Gil Rendle is on a very short list of our wisest guides in the practice of leadership in the United Methodist Church. And for those of us tempted toward a nostalgia that is avoidance, an empathy that is unhelpful, and a weariness that is escapist, he urges us to engage with courage and conviction. Quietly Courageous is the summation of decades of persistent attention and deep learning about how we have come to this place, and who God calls us to be in service to the mission. (Kenneth H. Carter Jr., president of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church; author of Embracing the Wideness)<br><br>Quietly Courageous reveals that we &#x2018;are not the product of things gone wrong but rather of the world grown different.&#x2019;Rendle brings his prophetic powers of observation to bear on the assumptions and temptations standing between us and more effective leadership. The reader emerges from this book with a fresh framing of where we stand, how we got here, and what needs to happen next. (Susan Beaumont, author of Inside the Large Congregation)<br><br>Gil Rendle has more than a bit of quiet courage as he engages the challenges facing pastors and congregations in this new mission age. He pulls apart the norms and practices that have become our shackles. Seeing the wilderness as an opportunity, Rendle then leads the reader into a reflection that allows humble movement toward God&#x2019;s imagined mission. (C. Andrew Doyle, Episcopal bishop; author of Voc�ti�: Imaging a Visible Church)<br><br>Gil Rendle compassionately turns us away from our preoccupation with feeding old anxieties about how to lead our organizations. He walks with us toward a newfound courage to be discovered within the deep waters of yet unimagined possibilities (Thomas V. Wolfe, President and CEO, Iliff School of Theology)</p><h2>12 Keys to a Healthier Cancer Patient: Unlocking Your Body&#39;s Incredible Ability to Heal Itself While Working with Your Doctor</h2><p><p><strong>The keys for the cancer patient to improve quality and quantity of life and chances for a complete remission while working with your doctor</strong><br><br>Cancer has escalated from a once obscure disease to a leading cause of death worldwide.

Racism is truly our nation's original sin.<br><br>"It's time we right this unacceptable wrong," says bestselling author and leading Christian activist Jim Wallis. Fifty years ago, Wallis was driven away from his faith by a white church that considered dealing with racism to be taboo. His participation in the civil rights movement brought him back when he discovered a faith that commands racial justice. Yet as recent tragedies confirm, we continue to suffer from the legacy of racism. The old patterns of white privilege are colliding with the changing demographics of a diverse nation. The church has been slow to respond, and Sunday morning is still the most segregated hour of the week.<br><br>In <i>America's Original Sin</i>,<i> </i>Wallis offers a prophetic and deeply personal call to action in overcoming the racism so ingrained in American society. He speaks candidly to Christians--particularly white Christians--urging them to cross a new bridge toward racial justice and healing.<br><br>Whenever divided cultures and gridlocked power structures fail to end systemic sin, faith communities can help lead the way to grassroots change. Probing yet positive, biblically rooted yet highly practical, this book shows people of faith how they can work together to overcome the embedded racism in America, galvanizing a movement to cross the bridge to a multiracial church and a new America.</p><p><b>A book that every white person--especially every white Christian--must read.<br></b><br>"Jim Wallis marches among our hardiest and most steadfast pioneers on the path to a more perfect union and a more vibrant faith. <i>America's Original Sin</i> is a powerful act of Spirit-led truth telling and a loving disruption of the status quo. Wallis calls us to transcend racial categories and to see in one another the image of God. He points out the structural realities of sinful racism and makes clear that to be redeemed, we must do more than deny it. This is required reading for all who believe in the promises of God, hope for the American democracy, and long to see the power of a justice ethos grounded in love."<br>--<b>Rev. Dr. William Barber II</b>, president, North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP; author of <i>The Third Reconstruction<br></i><br>"I have been waiting a long time for this book. I have been waiting for a white, male, evangelical Christian to say what Jim Wallis has the courage to say. Jim, in his own inimitable way, invites us into a conversation about America's original sin that is long overdue.

He wasn't wearing his seatbelt, they said. But when fourteen-year-old Alex finds his uncle's windshield riddled with bullet holes, he knows it was no accident. What he doesn't know yet is that his uncle was killed while on a top-secret mission. But he is about to, and once he does, there is no turning back. Finding himself in the middle of terrorists, Alex must outsmart the people who want him dead. The government has given him the technology, but only he can provide the courage. Should he fail, every child in England will be murdered in cold blood.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Anthony Horowitz&nbsp;</b>(anthonyhorowitz.com) is a world-renowned screenwriter for film and television, having received multiple awards. And he is, of course, the author of the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Alex Rider novels, which have become bestsellers the world over, spawned a major motion picture, and a line of graphic novels. A master of the spy thriller, Anthony is the&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;writer authorized by both the Arthur Conan Doyle and Ian Fleming Estates to write original Sherlock Holmes and James Bond novels, respectively.&nbsp;Anthony lives with his wife in London, England; they are parents to two grown boys. Follow Anthony on&nbsp;Twitter @AnthonyHorowitz.An ode to rampant commercialism, this is not exactly based on Anthony Horowitz's thrill-a-second novel about 14-year-old Alex Rider, who discovers that his deceased uncle was a superspy and that Alex himself must face an evil businessman and his multitude of gruesome killers. No, this graphic novel springs from the screenplay for the recent movie, which is based on the novel--which, itself, is a clever compilation of James Bond movies. If it's possible, this is even more rapidly paced than the novel. Alex remains an appealing hero here, and the idea of a heroic teen up against insidious adults continues to be an extremely powerful draw for readers. The female art team casts the action in exciting manga style, and the digital colors produce an anime-like sense of depth and motion. Readers who already like Alex Rider will want this; even adventure lovers unfamiliar with the books will find it difficult to resist the hyperkinetic fun, although they may feel they have sold a bit of their souls to get it. <i>Jesse Karp</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.
